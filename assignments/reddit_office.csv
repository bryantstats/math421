2023-02-27,1677539773,"Mostly aimed towards the AP peeps: Is it normal for a business to receive 30 different utility billing statements for various meters, across all owned properties?","A bit of backstory (Not as relevant to the story): I somehow managed to get a job as an AP clerk, without any experience. (Didn't even have an accounting class in college, I graduated with a degree in Graphic design, I'll be honest, it was probably nepotism that got me the job, because my mom worked for one of the CEO's other businesses, and she was very successful with some marketing campaigns for him at the time, and she put my name forward for the job.) But, they needed someone to join, quick, and it's a non-profit, so they can't really afford what an AP clerk should probably be paid.  


Business details (More relevant to the story:) It's a non-profit that has split itself into many business entities, and has quite a lot of different outreach programs, and has many different buildings across the ""campus.""

So, I recently took over some more work from a coworker, and the expectation is that I trim down/optimize things, to make it faster to complete everything. ""One"" of the bills she was paying was the utility bills for the city. The main organization ""F"" receives \~60% of the bills of the total organization I'll call ""A"", coding them to individual subgroups within the business entity, and invoices out to a few of the smaller Entities for reimbursement. The other 40% are handled by another entity, I'll call ""C"", and they also invoice to a few other minor entities. Some of the utilities, C invoices F for, which in itself seems a bit weird, since F already works with the City and pays bills to them.   
While that's a minor nuisance, what's really intriguing is that the City sends about 50 different statements a month, for all the different meters on our properties.  
Some of the statements have multiple meters, and multiple kinds, (2 Electric meters and 1 Gas meter, for example), so if the city was only able to handle 1 meter per statement that would be one thing, but it doesn't appear as though that is a restriction.  


For the other accounts payable people out there, that have experience in businesses with many properties, is this typical?  


It should be noted that I live in a pretty dang small, old fashioned town, and I wouldn't be surprised if it's a limitation on the City's side, or just a byproduct of the business slowly growing and obtaining these properties over time.

2023-02-23,1677178672,Trades Offices,"Hello r/office I am currently working in an office for an electrical, plumbing, and HVAC company. We struggle daily with an inconsistent owner that insists on inserting himself into every aspect of the business including areas where he has little to no knowledge. He constantly changes the technicians scheduled to accommodate his own priorities, even at the expense of customers who have been scheduled for weeks. There is no accountability for technicians outside of the physical work (informing us of work that still needs to be done, issues that came up during a visit, etc.)

The owner treats the office staff as if we are baby sitters for the technicians and if there is a problem or dropped back it always blows back on us.

Salesperson quotes for a project without asking me (Category Manager). 

Turns out, it's a customized order. Salesperson leaves organization, leaves my contact info with customer and makes me deal with customer. This is not as per protocol at all. I am not supposed to talk to end customers directly. 

 Customer is the most annoying piece of shit I have ever met because he insists on getting hour long calls everyday, after work hours, to convince me to make the product quickly. 

I explain to him it isn't as simple as that because this is customized and we are a big company that is strict on procedure and it takes time to make a product. 

For reference, the customer is under the impression a product can be made and delivered within a week. Does not understand the fact that we follow procedures.

Now is starting to get angry at me, calling me incessantly and asking me to deliver the product ASAP because I sent him a compliance sheet yesterday. (This is just to bypass some testing, not because we are just considering making the product).

2023-01-31,1675183698,Office Prank #1 - The Scavenger Hunt,"Around mid July, I and a few other coworkers decided to play a prank on Angelo, the highest ranking low level finance guy -to avoid specifics. To further avoid specifics while providing some form of background, Angelo can be described as a man with the kindest attitude riddled with childhood insecurities perpetuated by a toxic home life and a rough job (this iceberg goes deeper fyi). The poor guy was feeling downer than usual due to an incident involving the state fair, Harry Styles, and she-hulk (not even joking). So, we coworkers got together and decided this was the perfect time to prank him via scavenger hunt. Now, we all have work badges that dont really do anything, however Angelo has the unique habit of losing his, which enrages his partner on occasion. We thought it would lighten his mood if we were to A) hide his badge in his desk B) leave a riddled clue leading to the next clue location, and C) repeat step B eight more times. The clues would eventually lead him back to his own desk (where it all began) when low and behold, the badge was right under his nose effectively making the hunt a true waste of time. It took us half an afternoon to set this up, Angelo being unaware of the entire operation. Cards hidden in our office, the break room, the recycling, the gender neutral bathroom, under the box of awful taffy we were all gifted at Christmas. They were everywhere. Angelo was in position, it was time. The first set of clues were solved pretty fast; under the keyboard, taped to the window, under the shoe that stepped in dogshit. But the ones that were downstairs were tricky. Up and down up and down he went, it put firefighter training to shame. By the time he got to the last clue, face red, sucking in air, his oversized lime shirt drenched in what I hoped was sweat, he found the last clue. Instead of some elaborate riddle or code to break it simply stated: Look under your desk. 

Although this all sounds harsh, by the end of the day Angelos boyish grin had returned to his face. For despite the multiple clues and sweat, during this time, Angelo was the center of attention, and that was more than enough for him.",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/10q3wui/office_prank_1_the_scavenger_hunt/

It's like even if I do the best work and solve all work things, he won't appreciate me. At the same time, when my colleague start talking he got calm down as if I am some kind of a villain in his picture. And it makes me feel much worse. 

When the call is going to end, he said sorry if he was rude or harsh. My colleague said, it's okay sir we understand sir bla bla and again I didn't say anything bcz i didn't want to give him the satisfaction of wtever he said was ok.

First time posting here.
I wanted to describe this situation at my work, without dragging on too much.

I started as an admin assistant at an office and I was the only office staff amongst 4 providers, running the office while my boss was working in a different state. We started getting really busy with insurance and one of our other providers needed an assistant so my boss hired a medical assistant. She has more experience than me in regards to insurance and has knowledge in those things that I admit, I definitely had no knowledge of, and I have learned a lot from her. I trained her for our office and our policies and how to schedule, etc.

We have been working together for less than a month, trying to split the work and my boss sits me down and lets me know that once she has the hours to give, she will be promoted to manager. 

That definitely upset me because I saw myself in that position in the near future. I definitely wouldve preferred to not train my superior, especially not the role Im interested in.

I am a young 23M who last year through the right connections, was offered a part-time position in a small (6-7 people) office that manages events at a university. My role is roughly 75% in-person client ""babysitting"" and 25% administrative (Paperwork, excel, emails, etc.)

Did you know that 59% of the Indian workforce is unhappy with their workplace?

Let's look at the factors that contribute to this statistic. They include

* **Basic needs**\- In addition to salary, employees require support in terms of healthcare, insurance, etc. Employees tend to be unhappy or dissatisfied when such needs are unmet. 
* **Autonomy**\- Unhealthy power dynamics and exploitative relationships lead to unmotivated employees. 
* **Mastery**\- A work environment that does not provide the resources or environment for employees to learn and grow leads to a decline in motivation or interest to persist. 
* **Belonging**\- Lack of community or comradery within the workplace can make employees feel disconnected and lead to increased absenteeism. 

Now you may have heard about the workplace culture at companies like Google and Microsoft. They are known to create a safe, comfortable, and engaging environment for their employees. There are various benefits associated with a happy workplace. For instance, happy employees are great assets to the company as it leads to improvement in productivity, professionalism, and commitment. Further, the workplace motivates employees to go above and beyond as they perceive the organization's success as their own. Finally, there is a sense of belongingness and a strong community that forms as a result of a cooperative and safe workplace.",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/zyvkog/how_to_create_a_happy_workplace/

I have a coworker that leaves behind horrible messes in the bathroom. The messes are so gross, that many people walk three flights of stairs to use another restroom when they encounter the messes. With a fear of being too graphic, she ""slimes"" the toilet seat and leaves behind long pubic hairs. I will never fault anyone for the smell they leave behind in a bathroom because that cannot be controlled; however, we have bathroom spray available and she does not use it. Lastly, and this is another thing you cannot really control, she leaves huge smears in the bowl which could be addressed by double flushing. Mostly and mainly- the body fluid and hair on the toilet seat are what bothers me the most. 

Most times I wipe the seat off with a clorox wipe when I encounter the mess, but I really feel like I shouldn't have to. Isn't it common courtesy to clean up after yourself? Yesterday the mess was so gross, that I just walked three flights of stairs to use another bathroom. People do that often around this building. 

Our workplace has 6 women and a really nice, clean restroom. It's a single bathroom, so you're able to lock the door and have privacy. It's so blatantly obvious who is leaving the mess, but everyone just sort of deals with it or talks about the issue behind this woman's back. No one has ever confronted her about it.

I understand and respect her choice. But she changed after that day. She became understandably reserved. 


But now I am under constant fear that she may misuse my letter. Or if office choses to take adverse action. This fear keeps me constantly occupied. Beyond this I also feel.like a criminal.

In that specific meeting today, one of my teammates (lets call him John) was in it, and when they called my name and I wasnt there, he decided to interject. Typically if someone isnt there and their name is called, theres around 3-5 seconds of silence and we move on. However, he decided (in front of 20-30 people) say wheres Sam? (Fake name for myself) why isnt Sam in this meeting? Is Sam even working today? Is Sam even in the office? Where is she? 
One of my other coworkers told me, and said that his tone sounded very passive aggressive and that it seemed like he was throwing me under the bus. I messaged him directly and said Hi John, sorry for missing that meeting. I am at work and Im in the office today.

I only said my part. I then responded with yes, someone did contact me with what you said. Im not upset, I am just confused as to why you said that haha! He read the message and didnt respond.

I buy all the stocking gifts. This year I am buying for roughly 250 people, with $35 spend per person. I can buy from bulk retailers like Ali Express so I'm not worried about sourcing, just need ideas. The stockings consist of 5-6 ""gifts"" and the rest are the main stays like a packet of hot chocolate, candy cane, scratch ticket etc. 

Last year items included - $5 Starbucks GC, reusable cutlery in a container, company branded jar opener, eucalyptus shower steamer and a seed ball for herbs.

Items must be gender neutral,can be bulk bought, and I would like them to be useful.

However, i have a teammate who cribs a lot. She joined 6months ago and she started complaining about everything in just 2-3 months. I became friends with her because we are originally from a nearby place and we are currently located in the city which has a completely different language. 

She lost her father a few years ago and i am empathetic about it but she cribs about not being financially stable or having a lit of expenses on a daily basis. She makes everything about herself and tries to steal other's thunder. 

I am married and has a husband and most weekends we try to explore a new place together. She is so jealous and compares my lifestyle with hers. No other teammate does that and everyone talks about her when she is not around. 

She is a bit aggressive &amp; defensive when we try to tell her about her mistakes during work but this is personal. We don't want to indulge into any arguments &amp; fights with her. My team has only female members so we bonded really well but she just kills the vibe. 

She cannot se anyone being rewarded for their good work. All this thing makes the environment a bit negative.

Ive started feeling very excluded, and its getting me down and cannot bare to be around them anymore, they sit and laugh at inside jokes and take office banter to another level by making weird remarks on things and seeking attention from the males in the office, such as saying they are joining Only Fans waiting for one of the guys to hear, or complaining about there weight even though they are both not overweight or underweight etc. its safe to say I feel absolutely drained after leaving the office on my two days in.

It was a typical Monday morning. I was sitting at my desk, sipping my coffee and checking my email, when I suddenly felt a rumble in my stomach. I knew what was coming, so I quickly got up and headed to the bathroom. But it was too late.

As soon as I sat down on the toilet, I unleashed a torrent of liquid fire. It was so bad that I had to double over in pain. I tried to hold it in, but it was no use. It just kept coming.

By the time I was finished, my desk drawer was covered in poop. I was horrified. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't just leave it there, but I didn't want to clean it up either.

So I did what any sane person would do. I posted about it on Reddit.

I thought that maybe other people had been through the same thing and could offer some advice. But instead, I got downvoted into oblivion. People were calling me names and telling me to grow up.

I was so embarrassed. I deleted the post and went back to my desk. I didn't know what else to do.

But then, something amazing happened. My boss came over to my desk and asked me if I was okay. I told him what had happened, and he just laughed.

""It happens to the best of us,"" he said. ""Don't worry about it.""

He then helped me clean up the mess, and I was able to go back to work.

I was so grateful for my boss's understanding. He made me feel like it was no big deal, even though it was.

That experience taught me a valuable lesson. It's okay to make mistakes. Everyone does it. And it's important to have people in your life who will support you, no matter what.",office,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/12yuj6j/another_cool_office_story/

I was sitting at my desk, working on a presentation for a big meeting the next day. I had been feeling a little under the weather all day, but I had ignored it, thinking it was just a stomach bug. But then, I felt a sudden urge to go to the bathroom. I quickly got up and ran to the restroom, but it was too late. I had explosive diarrhea all over my desk drawer.

I was mortified. I didn't know what to do. I couldn't just leave it there, but I didn't want to clean it up either. I was so embarrassed.

I decided to just go home and pretend like nothing happened. I figured that if I didn't say anything, no one would know.

But the next day, when I came into the office, there was a big sign on my desk that said ""Congratulations! You won the Golden Turd Award!""

I was confused. I didn't know what the Golden Turd Award was.

I went to my boss's office to ask him about it. He told me that it was an award that the office gave out to the person who had the most embarrassing moment of the year.

I was shocked. I couldn't believe that I had won the Golden Turd Award.

But then, I started to laugh. I realized that it was actually kind of funny. And I was glad that I had been able to make everyone laugh.

So, I accepted the award with pride. And I vowed to never let it happen again.

But, as we all know, life is full of surprises. And a few months later, I found myself in the same situation. I had explosive diarrhea all over my desk drawer again.

This time, I didn't even try to hide it. I just walked out of my office and told everyone what had happened.

Everyone laughed. And then, they gave me another Golden Turd Award.

I've won the Golden Turd Award twice now. And I'm proud of it. Because it means that I'm a part of this office. And I'm a part of this family.

And we all have our embarrassing moments. But we laugh at them. And we move on.

So, if you're ever feeling embarrassed, just remember that you're not alone. And that you might just win an award for it",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/12ya52o/wholesome_office_story/

How to choose the right commercial cleaning company:

Keeping your workspace clean and organized is important for the health and safety of your employees, as well as for maintaining a professional image. However, cleaning can be a time-consuming and tedious task, which is why many businesses opt to hire a commercial cleaning company. But with so many options available, how do you choose the right one for your business? Here are some factors to consider:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qng9i9sfqrva1.png?width=612&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7db66e4b613134332f218c6a123fc9f4bdf30cd1

1. Experience and Reputation

One of the most important factors to consider when choosing a commercial cleaning company is their experience and reputation. Look for a company that has been in business for several years and has a proven track record of [providing quality cleaning services.](http://smartcleaning.com.au/) You can also check online reviews and testimonials from previous clients to get a sense of their reputation.

1. Services Offered

Different commercial cleaning companies offer different services, so it's important to choose one that can meet your specific needs. Do you need daily or weekly cleaning? Do you need specialized cleaning services like [carpet cleaning](https://scsgroup.com.au/cleaning/) or window cleaning? Make sure the company you choose offers the services you need.

1. Training and Certification

Cleaning may seem like a simple task, but it actually requires specialized training and certification. Look for a commercial cleaning company that invests in their employees' training and certification to ensure that they are equipped to handle any cleaning task safely and efficiently.

1. Insurance and Bonding

Accidents can happen during the cleaning process, so it's important to choose a company that is properly insured and bonded. This will protect you from liability in case of any accidents or damages that occur during the cleaning process.

1. Cost

Of course, cost is always a factor when choosing a commercial cleaning company. However, it's important to remember that the cheapest option may not always be the best option. Look for a company that offers competitive pricing while still providing quality services.

1. Availability and flexibility

Finally, consider the availability and flexibility of the [commercial cleaning company](https://scsgroup.com.au/industries/commercial/). Do they offer [cleaning services in Melbourne](https://www.scsgroup.com.au/victoria/) at times that are convenient for your business? Are they willing to work around your schedule and adjust their services as needed? Make sure the company you choose can accommodate your needs.

In conclusion, choosing the right commercial cleaning company can make a big difference in the cleanliness and overall appearance of your business. By considering factors like experience, services offered, training and certification, insurance and bonding, cost, availability, and flexibility, you can find a [professional cleaning company](https://scsgroup.com.au/cleaning/) that meets your specific needs and helps keep your workspace clean and organized.",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/12x4mds/how_to_choose_the_right_commercial_cleaning/

I'm very interested in hearing people's perspective on mental health in the workplace. 

Do you believe your manager/boss is supposed to be supporting you with your mental health. 

Is there a dedicated person you can trust at work with mental health challenges or do you keep your health situations separate from your workplace. 

Examples of mental health challenges can be burnout, anxiety, stress, difficulty focusing or managing your mental health disorder if you have one. 

Thanks!

The times I start working hard or trying to knock out big amounts of tasks because there is a lot to do, my coworkers also pick up the pace and start mimicking the things I do? Or will try and match the amount of phone calls I am making? Or making passive aggressive comments.

I've also noticed my manager will come around and start making compliments toward my other coworker like ""wow Christian that's a lot of faxes you are going through."" She will then look at the lead and point it out to give him recognition.

It seems to me as though they are feeling like I am trying to work hard to either: 1. Portray them as lazy/make them look bad 2. Outshow them

The other thoughts I have is they think I am looking for validation, recognition, and/or praise?

I also think they could simply be competitive but something about the way it all happens speaks differently to me.

Anybody have any similar situations, feedback, or ideas?

2023-03-30,1680180097,Is this harassment or am I overreacting?,"**\*Summary at the end of post\***

Can someone please tell me if I'm overreacting or if I should say something?

I'm a 16 year old girl that has somehow landed a part time job as an assistant in a head-office (I graduated high school a year younger). Although I'm under-qualified for the role, I have managed to gain respect from coworkers for my hard work and I'm very grateful for this opportunity.

A few weeks ago, a man (28M) was hired and placed next to me (we have a conjoining desk and we sit at opposite ends). When he first started we both communicated in a cordial manner and I was happy to see a fresh face at work.

But within the week I've noticed his behaviour changing (examples listed down below):

* He constantly interrupts my work to ask questions (which is fine) but then he will quickly steer the conversation to something else about his personal life and I don't really want to hear about it
* He quietly moves his roller chair in my direction and pokes me on the shoulder when asking these questions which startles me as I don't like being touched
* When I get up and go to the printer he follows me and pretends he is looking for something 
* There has been a few times where I have been discussing a tech issue with someone else and he moves over to my desk uninvited, puts his body in-front of mine to use my keyboard and cursor at my computer and tries to fix it himself. I tell him that it's fine and to go back to your desk but he doesn't listen. This also seems innocent but it feel like he jumped at the chance to 'help' so he could invade my personal space. I felt very uncomfortable in the moment but I could have also been overreacting
* I find him turning around at his desk to watch me while I'm working, but then when I look at him to ask if he needs help he says he doesn't?
* He keeps trying to play around with me by waving random objects in my face but it just startles me every time. I never engage with these actions but he keeps doing it.

We work in an open area with two managers and another full time colleague (26F). Logically, he should be asking her or the managers these questions as she has much more experience than I do, I am only a 16 year old assistant at the end of the day. Even though we share a desk he is closer to our manager and 26F so it actually makes more sense for him to be asking them questions.

He never acts this way with any one other than me which makes me feel like I'm being targeted. He also waits until times when my managers and 26F are out of the area when he does these things to me.

There have been no sexual comments/harassment/advances towards me and on paper, all of this behaviour can easily be deemed innocent which is why I know talking to my managers won't work. I don't feel like this is harassment (tell me if I'm wrong) but more of an issue where he has no self awareness?

I have tried giving him short answers, negatively reacting to him touching me by quickly moving my shoulder forward and away from him, wearing headphones, making it look like I'm really busy to give him hints that I don't want him to talk to me but he doesn't get them.

Please tell me what I can say to him, I feel so smothered, drained and emotional at my desk. I have to go on walks during my day because I feel so overwhelmed by him and it has made me dread coming into work. 

**SUMMARY**

A newly hired man (28M) keeps annoying me (16F) at work, gets up in my personal space, follows me around the office, watches me while i work, constantly asks me questions that he knows the answer to so he can start telling me about his personal life and more. He doesn't do this to anyone else, but all this can be deemed innocent so I can't tell managers he is harassing me. He is also a nice guy and is really well liked by managers (they don't see this behaviour).

2023-03-30,1680140895,"Basically getting a promotion, so why do I feel like I'm being demoted?","Hey, I was just hoping you guys could help me understand this feeling I have? I'm probably just tired or stressed today, and letting that affect me, but I'd love some sort of support if I could get it?

So what happened was this:

I lead a group of qa automation engineers. I am not their manager, but I lead the QA side of things and direct all efforts in this area in development. My manager is the leader of the org. He's my friend and I trust him and I have really grown under him. I started as a qa guy, and moved all the way up to my leadership role. I've never been in leadership before, so I struggled with one or two of my team by miscommunicating, but any residual problems are with their own attitude rather than mine, as I continue to support them and work with them. Ultimately, I've been successful in everything in my role and got multiple promotions in two years.

So my manager told me for our department's direction, we're going to promote all of them to software engineers and drive test-driven development across the board, and they will get to grow and help testing efforts get faster as developers. we'll have no more qa doing those automated tests.

My role is changing to no longer just direct that team, but every developer in the org, with dev leads reporting test metrics to me.

Sounds great, right?

The thing is, I've not been as good at verbal communication in meetings or with a few people, and so what this does is take that responsibility from me and that's where I was still growing a lot and even though it was stressful, it was enjoyable. I love the team. I've even been getting better.

I'm basically losing more opportunities to lead directly, and gaining more oversight leadership responsibilities. I also get to code more, which is awesome, and I still report to my manager.

For some reason though, I can't get it out of my head that some of my responsibilities are changing partly because I wasn't as good at that part. My manager is even saying he wants to take over the team meeting I generally run and have succeeded at, because it is department wide now, not just qa, but I'm still considered the expert at automation, so shouldn't I still lead that meeting?

I think this last bit is throwing me off. It makes me think even though my manager values me and I have done amazing work, he's targeting responsibilities that I maybe wasn't as good at, and removing them from the equation, so maybe this part feels like a demotion to me, even though I'm doing more in other ways. My title also isn't changing alongside the others. I stay the same title with a different role. I feel like the title should change...

Sorry for the long post. Any thoughts that could help me feel better about this? I should be ecstatic, but some parts of it don't feel right. Either way, the actual change is the right change for our department, just not sure about me. And it could totally just be I need to process, but something feels off.

I'll talk to my manager about it again tomorrow, but I'm really stressed and down about this tonight.

He also mentioned that Sam is very  opinionated and been going back and forth with Sam for like a week. However Sam is one of his top workers. Either way hes ok with Sam staying or going.  I had my interview Tuesday with Sam. The interview went really well, 7 years of experience and a ton of knowledge about our clients and their products. So he getting the job.   

My new boss sat in on the interview and had nothing but praises. She (Alex) then proceeded to ask me about one of the questions Sam asked. He wanted to know how many people made incentives on my team. I explained the situation to her without a lot of details. Just that he struggled to meet incentive based off what Jon said. She said that makes senses and we end the call. Then today my bosses boss (Keli) called me, she just got a promotion to VP but was my previous boss. 

Keli started the meeting off asking some questions on current projects. Then about some changes that will effect the amount of employees I will have. Then she asked me about Jon and what I heard. I gave her the same info I gave Alex. Without telling all the details she mentions that theyve been at it for a while, Jon is probably trying to keep me from approving the transfer. She now wants to speak with HR and have me write a statement about our convo. 

I dont think Jon had ill will but simply wanted to vent. I also didnt think it was that big of the deal but Keli wants the statement tomorrow. I want to try and talk Keli out of it but being knew to the company and industry I dont feel like I can. Jon just recently got married and barely out of some serious hardships. His wife stole several gs from her job and currently doing community care.  Our office is pretty close, especially us managers. I feel like this is going to make my job harder as we rely on he other teams for information and pricing. I deal with a large amount of Jon cases. What would you do?

During the first month, I tried my best to familiarize myself with all of the projects and products of the company. I noticed in the first general meeting that the CEO was big on KPIs and monitoring them. So I came up with a system to monitor sales performance in the best way possible considering my limited knowledge of the company's workflow.

Now, I have no access or permission to conduct interviews and attend external meetings or negotiate on behalf of the company. So I started working on all the theoretical stuff, and by the end of the month, I had developed a full list of necessary and important metrics and turned them into spreadsheets to calculate all the necessary KPIs, including CLV, NPS, etc. I also decided to analyze one of the products and marked all of its marketing flaws and restructured its value messaging.

I emailed the CEO and sent him a summarized report of what I had been doing, and I asked to be pointed in a general direction, or to be given my next tasks. He thanked me for the work and advised me on aligning metrics with company strategies, which I did immediately after.

In the meeting, presenting what I had gathered and worked on, he barely paid any attention to the spreadsheets and metrics. And before I could even begin to talk about how I plan on using them, he told me that he expected me to do something entirely different! which was to go into projects, talk to project managers and define my own role in the projects. He also stated that what I had done was too theoretical.

When I tried to talk about what I think should be done in terms of practically moving forward one of the projects, he stopped me by saying that ""that's a business development issue, you should focus on sales development for now.""

But by the end of the meeting, he was insisting that I should also assist in business development.

Honestly, I'm baffled by all this. I have no idea what I should be doing. and I'm convinced that even the CEO himself doesn't know what he wants from me.

What do you think I should do in this position? How am I even supposed to define my own role when I have no idea what's going on in this company on a managerial level?",office,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/14tze9z/need_help_i_have_no_idea_what_to_do_at_my_new_job/

Not only did her own email signature contain the company name typed out, her included example of an approved signature did as well. =D

Is there a way I can setup the meeting and then send the link to the students and the trainer (who is a contractor, not actually an employee) and have the trainer run the meeting from a Guest account?

With Zoom, we would literally just give the Zoom link to the students and trainers, trainer joins and starts hosting the meeting, recordings would go to our Zoom account for later use.  We want to replicate this, but in MS Teams.

It's a 24/7 call center. Up until recently, we were allowed to have the overhead lights on, off, or partially on (there's two sets on each side of the room). The room has large east facing windows, and there is PLENTY of sun throughout the daytime hours. We also each have 3 monitors that we are looking at the entire time we are working, and desk lamps available.

A different coworker kept leaving a folding step stool in the walkway (she is too short to reach her locker). A different person tripped on the step stool, and my manager said that they tripped because the lights were off. Thus, one set of each lights on each side must remain on 24/7.

Several months have gone by, and all of us in the office (my manager has a different room that he works out of) are tired of having the overhead lights always on. It's draining, and we've noticed we are more tired and grumpy with them on. One person turned the lights completely off on one side of the room.

My manager's reaction when he saw this was to slam on the lights like an irate house wife. He then went to building management and ordered a lock for our light switches. We asked the team that would install it if they had ever heard of this before, and they hadn't. They also said we would be the only room in the (rather large) building that would have this.

2023-06-05,1685992084,Speaker Phones,"OK, this has probably been asked before but I'm new here so I'm going to ask it again.  Why do so many people like to place calls on speakerphone?  I mean, are they not aware of how douchey this is, not just for the recipient but for the people that are in the area around the caller too?  I've worked in offices where coworkers would make calls on speaker and would leave their doors open.  This would allow all of us to be ""treated"" to the loud conversation taking place a few feet away from us while we are trying to get our own work done.  And if you are the recipient of said call, sometimes the caller is sitting across the room from the phone and when you ask politely to please take the call off of speaker they pretend not to hear you and continue to yell across the room as if *that's* the problem.  So, I ask anyone that feels like responding to please help me to understand why these people do this.  Is there a logical reason for this that I'm just not getting?  Because the only answer I can come up with is that they are dicks.",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/141oipr/speaker_phones/

2023-05-27,1685231681,Upcoming raise,"Hi all,

So my mentor got my pay increase request moved to the top of the pile, likely to be seen by the owner this coming week. It was submitted some time ago by my boss, and is not representative of what it should be now. (Its been awhile; company has been struggling and we had a raise freeze & but its like that everywhere where I live.) Its finally getting better, and a deal with the new bank is expected to be finalized at the end of June, at which point our owner will be likely to be much more generous.

If I get the increase before then and its not what I had hoped for (and what is typical for our area; CA pay rates are now public), should I refuse it, say the rate I want, and wait? Im currently within ballpark, but at the very low end and have had a lot of accomplishments in my 15 years that I believe make me deserving of at least midpoint.

Not interested in looking at another company; Ive been here for many years and have been promoted every few (and will be up for the one my boss created for me soon, but wanted to get the raise for my current position first). I love my colleagues and, apart from the raise delay and crappy health insurance, which is also common here, switching companies would make no sense (to start from scratch for maybe a few thousand dollars per year more). Not a consideration. 

Just wondering about whether I should accept it or not, even if its lower than what I think is fair.",office,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/13tm0c7/upcoming_raise/

2023-05-24,1684963252,"I don't have the word to describe this feeling - confusing, sad, and may be disappointment. (Kind of ranting but also need advice on how to think through this situation)","I have been with this company for almost 5 years now. I have contributed a lot, have always given my best. Anyone who have worked with me has nothing but the best. The company is in its growth phase and has given me lots of opportunities to explore and learn diverse set of skills. I have moved from one team to another learning the in-and-out of the end-to-end service we provide for clients. Because of this experience, and after interviewing, I got placed/hired into a new team of two. The other person works 50% with me and the rest with another team. After two years of being in this team of one, I realized that I have been doing manager-level work, although I have junior level positions. I shared with my manager the same observation and communicated to him of the career path I had envisioned for myself. This prompted a conversation among the leadership team and then they came back to me saying that they are opening a manager role for my team. But I have to apply and interview for that role. Also, they will be accepting candidates from other team. 

When asked if I lack skills from being considered for the promotion, they simply responded ""No"" but they want to open up the roles for others as well in the organization.

What I can't comprehend is - I have been kind of the founding member for this team. And despite lacking no skills to be promoted, they won't consider promoting me. Granted that there is a 60-70% overlap of the skills between me and my colleagues in a different team. But there's 30% specialized skillsets for this team.

I agreed to be a part of this new team because I was unhappy in my previous team. My manager left and I was in line for his position. But they told me then that I didn't have the skills to lead a team. So, they hired someone else, whom I had to train. He came onboard but I was the one running the meetings. 

If the job market hasn't been this shitty and if I were not limited by my work-visa, I would have left this company. 

I love the work I am doing but my boss is ""meh""

Anyway, he got a new girlfriend who is the office assistant at work. He's 35 she's nearly 50. He keeps her a secret in the office. However, in the last year a new girl has started work. I genuinely believe she has no idea about his girlfriend (no one in the office does). Apart from me.

This girls behaviour has changed and i asked him and they are sleeping together on a casual basis.

His girlfriend has no idea, and the new girl has no idea he has a girlfriend who sits 100ft away from her.

His behaviour is starting to become more reckless. We have a running community at work they went running together (the young female and him) one lunch time. They came back, she went to the office showers and he followed. There is only one shower. She came out looking very worried (supposedly about being caught) he came out looking pleased with himself. 2 hrs later his girlfriend turns up and they leave the office together. I feel terrible and I'm wondering whether I can even continue to be his friend because I feel so bad for both women.

Morally, I dont even know what to do because I know! Do I betray him and tell them? Do I keep quiet because it's none of my bees wax? It's ruining my concentration at work because I recently saw whilst at the printer the new girl with her phone. I saw he had sent a provocative photo of himself whilst in the office toilets. She was giggling at her phone and then 30 mins later he took his girlfriend out to lunch.

I tried to approach him about it and he just laughed and said 'you're looking good today'

I've got no where to go with it HR wise. We don't forbid relationships at work and I have no evidence other than what has been said but he could deny that

In the starting of joining a new office. I was developing a friendship with 4 of my other coworkers. We used to leave from office together and sometimes smoked up. 
I hadn't started calling them my friends yet because I would need my time for it. 
One of these people, a guy acted weird twice. 
One day when we were going home, I invited him to my home ( which I think could seem like something else), it was only because I have generally done this with other males, and none of them read it wrong. He hinted me that he thought I was leading him on, which I understand, but I already knew that he had a girlfriend and I live with my sister and that day some friends also came over. 
Then one day he became paranoid that I had something going on with other coworker, and he asked me to show him my phone, I asked her why he didn't tell me. Then when I opened my phone he snatched it from me and started checking my call record. This drove me mad and I took my phone back. He told me that it was anxiety, and told me how he thinks that things won't be platonic between us. This was a big red flag because he already had a girlfriend. He also told me that he didn't know if he loves her, it's just that the sex is good. The other day when we talked he denied that he grabbed my phone, but I disagreed strongly and then he agreed. I made it very clear that we're strictly professional and I don't want to be anything apart from this. We hadn't talked after it apart from something work related. 
I never told any coworker about it because it happened outside office. Now 2 of my coworkers got some hint of it because they have seen me ignoring his presence, and they want to know what happened.

I'm 40. I've been a (PC and console) gamer since I was 7, pursued IT in high school and early college (hated it, so I did something else), was a BIGTIME gamer through my early 20s (I lived through classic World of Warcraft - 8-10-hour binges, days on end were ""normal"") and still play quite a lot of games and spend a good amount of time on a computer nowadays. Even as I was a teacher, I spent more time on the computer prepping than most of my colleagues, since I used a whole lot more cool digital tools I'd find (this went into overdrive mid-2020 due to COVID and remote learning, etc).

According to my contract, my working hours are from 9 am to 6 pm, which includes a 60-minute lunch break. Typically, I arrive at the office at either 9 am or 9:10 am. There are instances when I don't receive tasks until 10 am due to my manager's arrival time. Consequently, I find myself with a free hour. The issue I'm grappling with is that if I'm only given tasks at 10 am, how can I accurately claim that I've been working from 9 to 10 am?

Compounding the situation is the requirement to fill out timesheets detailing the tasks I've worked on and the corresponding timeframes. Additionally, I take a 15-minute tea break during the day. The request from my manager to work an extra 15 minutes beyond my designated hours has left me feeling undervalued and reminiscent of a ""slave.""

I'm at a loss for what to do in this predicament. Is it feasible for me to utilize a tea break as an excuse for a bathroom break instead?

When she joined my office we decided to start carpooling because we live in a small town about 20 minutes from the office. With the frequent carpooling we developed a good friendship. 
After a month of knowing her we decided to go to our local bar. She invited a guy she had been talking to and I went solo. To make a long story short, the guy told her he wants to talk to me instead of her. 
(After our encounter I told her I didnt want to hang out with that guy again)

Anyways, her birthday month arrive, and so did lots of drama. She is a very insecure woman, and I am not. I started sensing jealousy, but at the time my dad was really sick. With all my own personal stuff I decided it was best to focus on myself and not worry about her being jealous. 
I have stopped carpooling and talking about my love life - she even told me Im jealous. This all made me take a step back. 

Forward to today, she approached me in the office, and with tears in her eyes told me Im not being a good friend. I offered for us to grab some drinks and hopefully settle our issues. I am not trying to have drama at work. However, she has proceeded to tell everyone in the office.

2023-08-20,1692566243,Hybrid work guilt.," 

Hi,  recently (5 months ago) I started working in a company where they  allowed hybrid work - 2 days in a week. You can take them, but don't  have to, you have to be at least 3 days in the office.

So  I've noticed my co workers that I work with in the office (they're  great!) usually take 1 or no WFH days. I'm not sure if they don't like  WFH (they do a lot of overtime) or if in the past there has been a  problem if someone was going WFH a lot.

When  WFH I do everything I'm supposed to do. In the office, I spend 1-2  hours talking to people anyway, as I have almost nothing to do. So when  working from home I can just chill and don't disturb other people.

Why  do I feel the guilt when I take WFH days? I feel pressured to be in the  office with everyone else and I cannot pinpoint why. When I know I will  be doing overtime, sure I will stay in the office no problem, I do like  my coworkers, but they're so busy sometimes I don't want to disturb  them. I want to take WFH as they might be taken away (I hope not, but  some companies are doing it) but on the other hand I feel like it will  look bad with my boss or co-workers like I am being lazy. Sure, there  are lazier WFH days, but there are days where I can focus hard and be  way more productive than in the office as there are no distractions or  constant coffee trips.

So far  nobody mentioned that I'm the only person that takes regular 2 days a  week of WFH. On WFH sheet I do notice that others are taking a ton of  WFH too, but I don't personally work with them, just occasionally.

Has  anyone else had the same experience of guilt by taking WFH? I don't  want my boss/co-workers think like I'm a lazy slob or something.",office,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/15wnabs/hybrid_work_guilt/

This is the email exchange. (Start at the bottom; per normal email threads.)

The topmost email has not yet been sent but is sitting in my Unsent Drafts folder.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Thank you.

Due to the short sighted and frankly, incompetent nature of the decision to move personnel to E Ave, I will be contacting my management to make alternative workplace arrangements.

-Pele

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Pele,

We confirmed that there will be NO soldering or other hot work within the new Building at E Ave. Other functions requiring space to accommodate hot work are remaining at T Road. We recommend that you speak with your manager to get clarity on your work location given that E Ave cannot accommodate soldering or other hot work.

Regarding parking at the Building at E Ave, currently, all in-building garage parking is reserved for operations and fleet vehicles. In the event of an emergency, parking spaces will be occupied by ----- staff. We haven't heard of the in-building parking process being changed in the future, but if you have questions, ----- ---- can provide you with the latest guidance. There is a public parking garage directly across the street from the Building at E Ave called the Hoffman Town Center garage, in addition to several other garages/lots in the neighborhood.

Thank you,

-----Moves Team


---------------------------------------------------------------------

IT Department,

The monitors and stand were personally purchased and are located within my office at T Rd. 

I can move them myself. I just need written direction, as current policy says NOT to move IT equipment, IT staff will NOT be moving personal IT items, and NOT to access E Ave prior to assigned work time.

It'll take me less than 20 mins, as E Ave and T Rd are in close proximity and I have access to a fleet pickup truck.

So long a someone emails me back that I can move these items, I can take care of it.

-Pele

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Good day Pele,
 
Please let us know where these devices are, and we will get them moved to you at E Ave; unfortunately, we can only move the IT Equipment  half way there..
 
Cheers

-IT Department

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Pele,

I'm awaiting information on work areas that could accommodate your workbench/metalwork activities and I'll share what the space planners say as soon as I hear back from them.

I'll also see what the guidance is regarding parking in the building based on your situation.

Regarding packages, only mail (e.g., letters, envelopes) is delivered to PO Boxes at ----- HQ and then couriered to E Ave. All packages, shipments, and boxes are shipped directly to each building, so there won't be an issue with getting large shipments delivered to E Ave.

Thank you,

-----Moves Team

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Urgency to get squared away is a bit of an understatement.
 
I've just noticed that most shipping is to be done to a PO Box. I receive oversized packages and pallets of material that require a loading bay and forklift on a semi-regular basis. These items will not fit into a PO box.
 
Let me be clear:

I have been downgraded from a 12 ft square office with access to a loading bay and machine shop to a cubicle workstation with open walls.

I am an engineer, not a secretary. I am passionate and dedicated to this profession, as it is rewarding and challenging work.
 
If I fire up a saw or a drill, it will negatively affect my neighboring coworkers.

If I start soldering, it will damage the desk and my neighboring coworkers will be negatively affected by the fumes.
 
I view and modify large blueprint style drawings using 
AutoCAD software. This is not well suited for a small laptop display. I often view multiple revisions of a drawing side by side. This is not well suited for one or two monitors.
 
Additionally, I am often called for emergency response at ALL HOURS. This includes midnight shift or during major service disruptions such as derailments, when the rail system is NOT IN OPERATION.

Without parking at a facility, I will not be able to respond after hours or during a service disrupting emergency.
 
I know everyone's excited about the shiny new building, but I am unable to work with it and do not feel that my position's needs were considered when this decision was made.

It's not personal... It is my job to build and maintain machinery. Without an adequately equipped workspace, I will not be able to do my job.

-Pele

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Pele,
 
Thank you for reaching out to -----Moves. Unless there is a pre-arranged agreement with IT, no IT equipment is being moved to E Ave and all IT left in the old buildings will be repurposed for other uses. 
 
I added ----- -----, ----- -----, and ----- ----- to this thread for their awareness. Please work with your relocation liaison (your new liaison is ----- ----- who I also added to this email thread) to coordinate with IT on any requested IT equipment that needs to be moved. I see you're in wave 3, which moves out this Friday, August 4, so there is some urgency to get you squared away.
 
Regarding your four monitors, I don't believe any monitors are moving to the new building, but I'll let -----, -----, and ----- ----- coordinate appropriate next steps with you and your relocation liaison.
 
Regarding your workbench, let me send out some feelers to see if I can get an answer for you. I'll reach back out to you soon.
 
Thank you,

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello:
 
The E Ave move guide specifies that most people have laptops to be moved. It does not mention desktops. I do not have a ----- issued laptop.
 
I have a high-end engineering desktop workstation for working in AutoCAD and I have four monitors Two 22 inch and two 28 inch monitors, as I work with large blueprint style plans and need a large amount of screen size to view these documents.  These four monitors are attached to a stand that's rather bulky and awkward to move.
 
How best should I prepare these items for moving to E Ave?
 
Also, my office at T Rd contains an electronics workbench with soldering station and metalworking tools for fabrication of electronic and mechanical parts for use in the field.
 
Is there adequate space at E Ave to accomodate these activities? If not, where can I perform these tasks?

-Pele

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi Pele,
 
Thank you for reaching out to -----Moves. ----- does not reimburse employees for personal vehicle parking while commuting to work, so any parking fees incurred will need to be covered by the employee. In addition to Huntington, there are several public parking garages close to the building as well; however, the daily parking fee is above $5 for those public garages.
 
We will be sending out a parking information email in the coming weeks with more information about parking options near the building.
 
If you have additional questions about -----'s parking policy or parking in general at -----, please contact ----- ----- who can best assist you.
 
If you have any other questions about the move or the E Ave building, please reach out to us at any time.
 
Thank you,
 
-----Moves Team


---------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello,
 
I am scheduled to be relocated to the E Ave building and have reviewed the FAQ for this move regarding Parking and Transit.
Per the FAQ, I will be parking at either the Huntington parking garage or Franconia-Springfield parking garage and taking transit to the building.
 
Parking at these locations costs $5 daily.
Are personnel relocating to this building going to be compensated for parking fees incurred?

C and I occasionally have spoken, she opened up to me about the divorce and it did not at all come across to me that B and she had an affair. I did not ask of course.

My vision on what appears to be one eye, gets a little foggy and it's hard to focus on the close-up distance of the monitors it seems. If I go for a 50 minute walk around the block I can focus just fine on distance but the side effect is still there if I was true to try and put my focus on a couple feet away like my monitors are.

The issue fades away after 30-60 minutes it seems and my vision is fine again.


Planning to go see the optometrist to discuss getting an optimized prescription for the computer work because my standard prescription is for being nearsighted, so it's typically at distance that my glasses benefit, but the monitor distance is also not clear without the glasses on.

I've set up my monitors on dark mode where I can and reduced the brightness, but I think the main issue is staring at Excel spreadsheets for extended periods of time.

I'm familiar with the look at something 20 ft away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes rule, but I've had a hard time implementing it, even with timers set up for every hour.

Anyone else experienced similar effects and can share their story and how they managed it?

I was thinking of increasing the font size, not sure if that'll make any difference if I'm staring at the same distance consistently.

Going to ask the optometrist about the blue light filters on a new set of lenses as well, I've heard people have experienced benefits from these.

2023-11-13,1699882434,Stuck in my family business,"I am a singaporean lady in my mid 30s (pregnant too) working in my family business. Sometimes I get very sick of my mom constantly telling me that one of our colleagues is the gold standard. It seems like that lady can do no wrong and everything that lady does is great.

I have a very different temperament (I am an introvert whereas that lady is extrovert, likes to have ALL the say, and a little manic [if I were to have a word to describe exactly how I find that lady to be, this would be the word] from that lady and having worked in other jobs where I have identified mentors/examples that are more similar to my temperament and have succeeded. I prefer to look up to them as examples to follow. 

It can get very tiring to be compared to that lady constantly. Or to be told that I should observe that lady to see how gold standard is (even though I do not agree in terms of my own definition on whats gold standard).
I actually feel quite a bit of resentment towards that lady and her gang, even more so when my mum shares about anything they talk about. Sometimes even though I like my job, I dont feel like staying in the company anymore.

Any suggestions on what I should do? Thanks.",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/17uaqjb/stuck_in_my_family_business/

Asking here for tips or guide about something that I want to create for work. To start off, I want to go on a Holiday, but the problem is that I don't have a back-up to cover the tasks that I'll be leaving behind. So, we are making plans to start training someone. Aside from the training, I also want to leave a material that can help as a guide or additional resource they can look at.
I'm thinking of creating a document where there's a form and they can just hover the pointer on each part, then a pop-up box will appear explaining what it is for and how to fill it out. I'm just not sure where to start or if there's a Microsoft application that can do this.

P.S. I think this kind of document will work well especially when training someone new. It's like some sort of a breakdown of a FORM, think of it like those charts you see when you go to your doctor's office about the human anatomy where it labels the different body parts. (I'm not sure if I'm making sense, but let me know in the comments if you have questions.

* B) You plan to take a break, but now you try to ""catch up"" (to be it like before) - eg by having an extra cup of coffee

&amp;#x200B;

What advantages and disadvantages do you see for each approach?

&amp;#x200B;

My opinion:

&amp;#x200B;

* ""B"" is more dangerous in my opinion (leads to excessive coffee consumption and generally reduces discipline when it comes to substance use... In addition, for example, you no longer remember exactly how a cup of coffee - energy boost - felt for the first time, so now you drink 4 cups because ""it's still I don't feel like the first time"").
* ""A"" is safer, but at the same time more ""depressing"" (""I was looking forward to the energy boost, but I feel so little..."" ""It's a waste of money when coffee doesn't do anything for me anymore."")

I come from an entertainment/freelance/content/social media background.

I loved it but wanted more stability so I started looking for more traditional office work and I landed a job at a nonprofit in Fundraising. I am incredibly used to a very steady workflow and not a ton of downtime (I'm used to relying on multiple sources of income at once). Since starting here I am able to complete the tasks I'm given very quickly and then I have nothing to do for the rest of the day.

I'm being as proactive as I can be about upcoming events and potential sponsors/ our annual appeal etc. But I still have a ton of downtime and run out of things to do.

This year we're looking at \~60-65 people, and we try to get it done in an hour.

We usually do Yankee Swap - when your name is drawn, you either choose a wrapped gift or steal something that someone else has already unwrapped. Max 3 steals per gift. All gifts are purchased by the company, unique (no dupes), and within a generous price range (\~$250-400, with a few bigger ticket items). Examples are: Ooni pizza oven, Yeti backpack cooler, VR headset, Vitamix, Roomba, etc.

Problem: it's fun to have every gift be different, but it ends up that only a handful are hot items (as in, they get stolen, or it just happens to be perfect for the person who originally opens it), and the rest are ""cool"" gifts but not something the winner wants or needs, which results in a lot of people asking to return their item for something else.

Ask: **How can I tweak the game so more folks are happy with what they receive, without losing the fun of it being a game?**

I was thinking of using gift cards (more universally usable?) and a spin wheel... something like:

1. Let's make a deal-ish: You can (1) open a new gift, (2) steal someone else's, or (3) spin the wheel for a gift card (Amazon, UberEats, Apple, etc.). Gift card values are uniform and all on the lower end of price range, *but* it's the safer choice because it's more likely you'll get something you can use.
2. Gift card game: No wrapped presents, everyone just spins the wheel which will be organized by *category* (i.e., Travel, E-tail, Food, etc.). Whatever category your spin lands on, you can choose which retailer you want the gift card from (e.g., if you land on E-tail, you can choose from Amazon, Apple, Google, Target, Best Buy).

I started to learn French and maybe, maybe not, you can imagine that I feel quite dumb when it comes to pronunciation and spelling. I can of course copy every word into google translate and use the load out function but this is kind of awkward.

Therefore, I was thinking that maybe this can also be done by Excel and the Google Translate API. So what I am looking for is a macro that calls the API to read out loud the cell it is pointing to by just clicking on a button next to its cell. Does anyone maybe have a link for this kind of Excel file? Cannot imagine that I am the only one with this need =

She started working here a few months ago. I tried my hardest to train her, but she never wrote notes, and would honestly act completely dazed and confused, and then start rambling about something personal. Last week she knew it was my wfh day and she walked to my cube to ask me a question, then acted shocked I wasnt there and turned to my coworker for help. My coworker has never done this process before and helped her figure it out, because all it was was a UPS return. Another day that same week the printer ran out of toner and she walked up to my cube with a blank stare and said ""name! Help!"". I asked her what was wrong, and she said ""printer not working."" I asked her to be more specific on what the issue was, and she said that the printer ran out of toner. There is a large sign in the copy room that states what to do if the printer runs out of toner, which is to put in a ticket to IT. Let me remind you shes 37 and seems to be incapable of using her words to describe what kind of issues shes having.

She seems to have gotten comfortable doing this because today our manager rejected a travel reimbursement she submitted, and she forwarded me the email exchange and said ""what should I do with below. Help please!"", only to me. She does this bit quite often when it comes to issues with anything, and won't ask a question or describe the issue but say ""help please!"" Like she is drowning or going to be eaten by sharks or something. Its weird.

I took a breath and responded ""i am not really sure what is going on here. Please speak with the manager on what actions you can take to resolve this."" She responds with ""i actually figured it out... thank you! Needed your moral support"". I dont know about you guys but thats not how moral support works. When she asks for the printer code, i tell her and she goes ""oh thanks, I just needed your moral support!"" 

Is there anything I can do regarding this? She does not cc the manager or anyone on email exchanges to me.

2023-10-12,1697076611,How can I reduce ink cartridge costs for my office printer?,"Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm a white-collar office worker, and I've recently assumed the role of being the go-to person for maintaining our office printer. The printing costs for our ink cartridges have really been eating into our department's budget, and I'm determined to find some effective ways to bring those expenses down.

I wanted to reach out to this great community and tap into your wisdom and experience. I'm specifically interested in exploring the following areas to help reduce the overhead of ink cartridges:

1. Are third-party ink cartridges a viable solution? Many of my colleagues have suggested going for these as they are usually cheaper. However, I'm concerned about potential risks like poor print quality or damage to the printer. Has anyone had experience with third-party cartridges, and would you recommend them?

2. Which ink cartridges have the best value for money? I'm aware that printer manufacturers tend to price their cartridges quite high. If there are any reliable alternatives that strike a balance between quality and cost, I'd love to hear your thoughts.

3. How can I find out the discounted price of the cartridges? Every time I need to click on various websites to check and compare, which is a big time cost

4. Any tips for optimizing ink usage? I've seen a few hacks online suggesting things like using a smaller font or printing in grayscale. Are there any other tactics or settings adjustments that can help us stretch our ink supplies further without compromising readability?

I'm open to any other suggestions or strategies you may have in mind that can help me tackle this challenge. Our office printer is a vital tool for our daily operations, and any savings we can generate on ink cartridges would be greatly appreciated by the entire team.Looking forward to hearing your valuable ideas and suggestions",office,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/175vm3v/how_can_i_reduce_ink_cartridge_costs_for_my/

2023-10-11,1696990383,"Out of my pay scale, and not my problem, right?","I've been with a company for over 19 years and need to get out of this soul-sucking position.  I've had issues with co-workers who absolutely refuse to do their own work, so to get things done, I've taken over quite a bit in the years I've been here.  I realized early this year that my hatred for work is becoming an issue at home and that's just not acceptable for the meager $60k salary ($92k is considered low income in my state so I'm technically poverty).  

About 2 months ago, I told them they needed to find a replacement and that I'd work with them to help where I could and train the new person accordingly.  I am then approached by an Executive who thinks it would be a good idea for me to create narrated video tutorials for whoever comes in after me.  I was so stunned by this ""request"" that I didn't even know how to reply.  

I took a couple of weeks to absorb this, then asked my therapist, and he told me that I was absolutely right for not jumping on this project.  They've already decided they'll need to outsource parts of my job because they will not find someone with a ridiculously eclectic background to replace me.  In what universe does a company have to ask an employee to do narrated video tutorials just because no one else knows their job?!?  

I just want to leave on a good note because I have some really epic relationships built with the owners, but I cannot accept this request.  Honestly, if just one person in this office knew what I did, I wouldn't hate this job so much.  However, if I go on holiday, my work just piles up and people are told to wait for my return.  Meanwhile, everyone else seems to have a team to support and assist when needed.  Why would I do anything extra for these people?  Yet, if I don't, how bad does that reflect on me?  

In any other part of my life, I don't care what random people think of me.  Professionally, however, I literally live on an island (Oahu) and negativity travels fast in the small professional city.  I cannot burn this bridge.  The owner has asked to be my professional reference!  Now what?",office,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/1752yzf/out_of_my_pay_scale_and_not_my_problem_right/

2023-09-16,1694872521,Dress Code Help for County Health Department Position?,"I am 23 M and just got an entry level position with my county's health department. I will be an inspector that goes about and checks compliance regarding health codes around the county. I interviewed and was offered the position with my beard grown and groomed, and the 3 interviewers never mentioned it being an issue or concern. The head of the department has a handlebar mustache with a goatee himself, so I assumed that clean, well-groomed facial hair would be allowed in the office. However, my Dad called recently and expressed his concern with my facial hair, saying that it may look unprofessional and inappropriate for a health inspector to be sporting any facial hair. He suggested to shave it to show that I am willing to take the initiative for the position, to show them I am thinking of ways that I can be the best at my job. He also mentioned that since I will be inspecting food establishments that they may use my beard as a way to complain to my boss that I am unprofessional/I knowledgeable/not representing the county in an appropriate way. 

What do you all think? Am I correct in assuming that a well-groomed and well-kept beard is acceptable in such a work environment, or is it more professional and ""taking the initiative"" to shave my beard and keep a clean face? Beard photos posted for reference! 

***PLEASE NOTE*** I haven't trimmed my beard in a couple of days, there are definitely some flyaway hairs and it is not perfect/exactly job-ready at the moment by any means! Just posted the photos so you all could get an idea of what the beard looked like.",office,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/16k86hp/dress_code_help_for_county_health_department/
2023-09-16,1694824084,Should I write to my laid off team member?,"Recently a member on my team was laid off. He worked remote so it was a quiet surprise that he was let go. 

The thing is, I feel like the decision makes a lot of sense. He was causing issues for the rest of the team and slowing us down. He was a nice guy and fun to chat with I guess, but I think work will be smoother now without him. I also wouldnt want him to count on me as a recommendation to another job. 

But I feel guilty for thinking all of that and I still feel bad for him. Is it fine to just let it be and not write to him to say goodbye or something?",office,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/office/comments/16jtliq/should_i_write_to_my_laid_off_team_member/
