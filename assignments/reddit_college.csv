2023-11-06,1699295553,"At my college, most of the professors will provide us with the exact same questions that will show up on the exams. Does your college do this? Its BS.","This year I transferred from a private school to a state school with a good reputation so that I could finish my degree. At the beginning of fall term, some students in my major told me that the courses I have to take this year are going to be super difficult. Fast forward to midterms: I studied for a lot for my midterms, and then when I took them, I realized all the questions on the midterms were just questions taken word-for-word from the homework. This happened in all four of my classes. Prior to the midterm in one of my classes, the professor strongly emphasized to just study the homework. Im kind of pissed off because I studied for a long time and got a good grade, but some other people in my class got the same grade, even though they dont really understand the material. It seems like the college is just passing everyone along.

Why do some colleges do this? It literally feels like cheating. Im getting an A, but honestly do I deserve it? Im not being accurately tested on the course material.
What I dont understand, though, is some people are still getting bad grades on the midterms, even though all the questions are questions weve seen before!! Maybe if the questions werent word-for-word, more people would fail out of college, and the college would lose money? Idk, Ive never experienced this before at any other college. The students at my college seem to lack work ethic, so now the coursework has to be easy for everyone. I feel like by just asking about questions weve seen before makes it so the students in my class cant work on their critical thinking skills..",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17p9hx6/at_my_college_most_of_the_professors_will_provide/

I was told that they initially assumed I had CS experience, despite my transcript showing no CS classes. Its incredibly frustrating that they didnt inform me about the recommendation against pursuing CS earlier, and now Im faced with the problem of becoming a part-time student.

I have a couple ideas of where I may want to apply and have applied early action to Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR) and Western Washington University (Bellingham, WA). I have toured both and I enjoy the amount of greenery. Especially with western- bellingham is so beautiful with its forests and the beach. Although it would take some adjustment to a drier/less mountainy green area like seattle it would be ok. I have like a 3.8 unweighted gpa and a couple good extra curriculars. In no way am I shooting for an ivy because I know I would be INCREDIBLY unhappy in an extremely competitive school. I dont even know what I want to major in. In general I just love nature and it brings me a lot of happiness so Im trying to find schools that will be that. Id be totally fine going to school in a city but I wouldnt like the lack of greenery (depends on the city I guess).

2023-11-05,1699214774,An art student that thinks more than he works.,"It's as the title says. I've trapped myself in an academic work box that's about to implode in roughly 36 hours. I'm in a higher level art studio class that self-directed and since the beginning it's like my drive to create art is just not there. It comes in brief moments of inspiration but does just as soon as it's born. I've had nearly 4 weeks to get this shit done but I've squandered every minute, hour, day, and (now) week up to where I am now. 

I currently have 2 incomplete 18x24 drawings and 0 completion on any of the 8 or so smaller drawings I implied I'd be bringing for Tuesday's critique. And it's not like I don't know what to do, I planned out at the beginning of my semester what my subjects and pieces would generally focus on. I'm to create drawings from a fictional world I created, semi-abstract pieces made of ink and charcoal, and bugs, marmots, and landscapes. I have all these drawings ideas written out to generally follow since the beginning of the semester and yet I've only completed one.

WTF is wrong with me, why haven't I had the energy to create artwork!? Why can't I muster the will to see just what I can really do!? I want to express myself through my work and yet I'm hesitant, too scared to begin the process. It's such weird and uncomfortable feeling: wanting to create art yet fearing that I'll hate the results. I'm too scared to attempt drawing and it disgusts me. I think of so many great things I want to draw and yet I can't bring myself to start. And now, the end draws closer and I'm as far away from adequate as feasibly possible for my class critique.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17okexm/an_art_student_that_thinks_more_than_he_works/

2023-11-05,1699200938,College is making me angry at everything,"So, I don't usually post on Reddit, but I wanted to see if anyone was experiencing anything similar to me.  I'm a junior at college up North and about 4 hours away from my hometown (where my boyfriend and best friends are).  Being at school makes me miserable and negative about everything.  I used to have quite a large friend group up here in freshman year, but since I stopped partying and drinking we've parted ways and I've grown to resent the people who I used to hang out with.  I lived with 3 of them last year in an apartment and they were probably some of the worst roommates imaginable.  Since then, I've moved into a new apartment with much more mellow roommates with whom I'm not close, but I enjoy talking to them occasionally.  However, I usually find myself in my room and avoiding all human contact during my free time.  This is what I like while I'm here.  I don't like socializing with the people around me at school because everyone and everything makes me SO angry up here.  I find that I get angry at the littlest things and I have negative thoughts all the time.  When people ask me to hang out or even if someone is just reaching out to talk to me, I get genuinely pissed off.  The thing is that when I go home or when I visit my friends, I don't feel this way.  I'm genuinely happy in my friends' company and I never feel burdened by them calling, texting, or making plans with me.  While I'm up at school, I'm constantly just waiting to go back home which I do about every two weeks to see my boyfriend.  It's just so draining to be so negative all the time.  I'm just scared that because I'm so negative here, it will impact the way I am at home or with my relationships that I truly care about.  I find that sometimes I pick fights with my boyfriend while I'm here, or I'll find myself getting annoyed with him in person when I'm anticipating having to go back to school.  For example, if I'm visiting home for the weekend and it's Saturday night (and I leave Sunday morning), I'll have this underlying dread about having to go back to college the next day and I'll start to lash out at him (I know this is super shitty of me and I'm 100% trying to work on it and be better for him).  It's too late for me to transfer schools and I wouldn't want to do that anyhow.  I know I can stick it out for the next year and a half, but I just want to know if this is something anyone else is dealing with or has dealt with before.  I'm looking for some tips and reassurance about this whole situation.  I know it's common to not necessarily like school, but I just have such a negative mindset and I want to truly change so that I can be a better girlfriend and just a better person while I'm up here.",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17ofaws/college_is_making_me_angry_at_everything/

2023-11-04,1699067853,"I am stuck in between two decisions, whats your opinion?","I am 20 and Im currently trying to decide between two different routes towards my higher education and my career at large. I would like to say that I am in a committed long term relationship and that holds a significant part in my decision, however, weve only been together for four months. Our schools are located 30 minutes away from each other. And both schools tuition/fees are around the same ballpark. I just want to weigh out my options. 
My options are as follows:
Option #1. I could stay the route Im at, I am a sophomore at a four year school getting a bachelors degree in human development and family science. I could continue this track, and once I graduate, I could start looking towards a certificate or license of a concentration. I know off the bat that I would like to work with adults primarily. The cons of this option are that I will stay at a school that I havent made a lot of social connections in, that I would be away from my partner, and the area is very spread out. I would most likely not be able to have an internship or otherwise if I were to stay in the area. Another thing is that I would have to room with a lot of people, (ie: renting a bedroom off campus). Although I am open to that, I dont know how that would go. 
Option #2. I could possibly transfer to my partners university for the upcoming fall semester and live with them. The major I am looking at is a child and family development bachelors. I read that the degree can be a little bit difficult to find a job in, but it can be implemented with some jobs/experience to lessen that difficulty. Most of my credits would transfer seamlessly, I would do the same route as stated previously and get a license or certificate for a concentration after graduation. The school is within walking distance to a lot of opportunities when it comes to internships, as it is more urban. Some cons would include a more expensive rent (only by $50), I would have to switch some of my classes around to satisfy this schools prerequisites, and it would be a bit of a hassle to get all of the transfer stuff figured out. 
Either way, my partner says that they just want me to be happy, and choose the best decision for myself.

2023-11-03,1698985914,Experiencing existential dread in college ( Undecided major and no career path),"I feel  I've hit a massive obstacle right now. I didn't plan on living for this long, so now I have no idea what to do moving forward. Even as a kid I didn't have any ""dream job"", I just wanted to think about the present.

I'm doubting myself like crazy. Do I even have any passions or hobbies? Does it matter if I like the major or not? Should I just focus on what makes the most money? Would it make my parents proud? Is it worth it? Why am I paying for classes that I don't even need? What am I doing with my life? 

I think I gotta eat properly or something of the sort because my mind is spiraling and I can't think straight.

My mom begged me after I graduated from high school to get enrolled in college immediately or my dad will want to kick me out of the house. Of course, I did so. My dad has disowned me beyond comprehension so far and he can barely interact with me as if I'm some unfortunate pitiful stranger. I wanna prove everyone wrong, that I am very much capable of taking care of myself and living as an adult.

Thing is... I have literally no knowledge of college/university or what even lies ahead. I'm just blindly taking courses and crying myself to sleep with how much homework I have. I don't even know where this homework will actually take me, I'm just doing it because that's all I know.

In spring, student disability service counselor at my college. First time talking to a college staff member face to face. Asked me if I plan on just going for general ed or if I'm planning on transferring to a state University or some big name universities. You could imagine my reaction, I was like what do those terms even mean? (She was using acronyms) Now second semester, currently mid way into the fall, I'm still clueless as to what all this college terminology is and why is there different types of schools like trade school or med school that I wasn't aware of?

Met up with academic counselor at 8am sharp because making appointments with them are hard to get because of the amount of slots taken. Talked to a guy and I straight up told him I literally don't know what I'm doing I'm just upset I'm paying $400 for classes I haven't taken yet. He said he'll change my major to liberal arts until I figure it out with a career counselor. Then with a career counselor over the phone(I was on my lunch break at work) she asks if I've taken any career assessments online before? the day before our appointment I was doing like 20 different tests with some confusing and frustrating results. She says okay well for now we'll talk again another time and it's been a full month or two since then.

I feel like this sub may get these posts often where someone's like: any major and career recommendations for a guy that likes science and hates math? So I won't particularly mention what I'm passionate about and what my values are unless prompted, but do know that I'm extremely picky.

Note: A lot of things are missing in this due to my fear of revealing where I live in the US and I literally cannot recall much more.

TDLR: What are some important college/university/career terminology? I'm clueless as to what I'm doing in my life and for my future, what are some ways I can actually confidently select a major and decide on a path to follow?

This time I want to go for a STEM major. I applied for Data Science and got in and while I'm definitely going to give it my best try I'm panicking a little seeing all the math classes I have to pass.

I rely heavily on lip reading in noisy environments where more then 2 or 3 people are talking and my hearing aids don't really help because they make background noise louder too. At events I have to focus so much and look at the organizer to ""hear"" them when they give instructions or call things out that I never get the chance to talk to other students.

It's also really weird to talk to other students because I don't really feel comfortable telling them I'm hearing impaired because I have had bad past experiences were they often forget or just don't care to look at me when talking or are unwilling to include me because of my hearing loss. 

How do I fix this or should I just give up socializing in college?

Recently I have decided that I am going to do a leave of absence during the spring semester and just get some credits at a college that is about 20 mins from my home.   After that I'm going to either transfer to the college close to home or return to my current college if not accepted. I did this because I am having a constant feeling of anxiety and slight depression. On top of that I am dealing with grief alone and have not been able to sleep well the last few weeks. I have only really made one friend besides my roommate and I just get really homesick whenever I think about home. My mom and I are super close and she is fully supportive of my decision to do a LoA and/or transfer. But I'm worried now that I may have made a wrong choice. I love the campus here and I am going to miss my friend and roommate but at the same time, the college I will be going to in the spring has a MUCH better program for my degree, is really close to home, and is also 20,000 less than the tuition I am currently paying. I really like living in the city and I like the campus but I don't think I could live away from my friends and family much longer. Overall I'm worried that I am a quitter, or that I am regressing,  and wonder if I made the right decision.

2023-11-02,1698966640,Withdrawing from College: Am I Crazy?,"As I said in another post, my life has been a mess past these two years. My Mother passed away unexpedectly in December 2021. Afterwards, it was just me and my Father. He took it hard and got engaged to his girlfriend short after my Mom's death. He also kicked me out in our new home and I had to fly back to my home state on the day before Christmas Eve to live with my friend and her family for a couple of months and finish community college.

Shortly after I graduated, my Father didn't want to take me back in and I lived with my Mom's side of the family. The problem is, while the area they live in is nice, ***there is NOTHING there.*** They live up in the mountains and in a different state, but there are very little jobs available. You also can't get around there if you do not have a car. There is also no public transportation and I am physically disabled so I can't walk there alone without any assistance.

I was going to college in my home state majoring in Accounting, but I knew that I didn't want to do Accounting and just wanted it for the ""stability"". But I decided I did not want to wait two years to live independently and decided I cannot go back to my Mom's side of the family's state when I graduate college to live with them.

Instead, I'm currently working as a subsitute teacher with the special needs kids and I found a very good shared room in a town with way more resources and public transportation. I'm also trying to find a part-time evening job and planning to do a quick certificate at a local community college in phblotomy. In the Spring, I plan to do school online and therefore, I withdrew from the semester as I know for a fact that my credits won't transfer. But I do know I have to pay the loans back until after I graduate.

Now, I did this without talking to my family at all, but I realized I needed to do it now rather than later. Because I did not want to sit there a few years after I graduate doing nothing and for them to drive me back and forth when I find new places and/or job interviews. As I said before, I also don't want to do Accounting (or any other business/marketing office job)

Now, let me explain why I chose this course. In high school, my parents, especially my father, wants me to pursue a career related to the cruise ship industry. Many of my relatives from both sides of the family work in the cruise ship industry, that's why my father believed it was a best path. He made it clear that the decision was still up to me, but he just really felt that the cruise ship industry was an best choice. Additionally, ny parents also suggested other courses like Accounting or related to Technology, such as IT, Computer Science, and more.

As I entered college, I settled on Hospitality Management. My decision was influenced by my father's preference. Well I also think Hospitality Management is really a good course because it has a wide range career opportunities. I also want to have a business in the future, like restaurant, resort, or any other related to Hospitality Management that's why I chose this course.

However, after a year has passed now that I'm second year, I've started to have some regrets. I find Hospitality Management as a boring course (sorry huhu), and I'm not good at cooking or whatsover (well I'm practcing cooking now) that's why I get tired of it and I don't find this course as enjoyable. 

As I search to internet, I've discovered that Marketing is incredibly engaging and enjoyable, especially when I read about the experiences of people working in that field on social media/internet. They enjoying the creative process of crafting compelling messages, designing eye-catching visuals, developing strategies to engage with audiences, analyzing market trends, managing social media communities, and more! This is precisely what I aspire to do. I understand that Marketing is also hard and challenging, but when I compare it to the two courses I mentioned, I find Marketing much more appealing. 

At this point, I'm unsure about what to do. I'm hesitant to switch courses because it would mean potentially wasting the two years I've invested in Hospitality Management.

But now that I have the opportunity to choose Law as a major, my research has been dull. I'm not the most studious, which means I probably won't have the best shot of getting top 25% in some T10 or T20 school. Then the actual work, 70-80 hours nights, no time to myself, possibly no benefits and a low salary, the absolute mountain of student debts.. it seems awful and i don't want to even give myself the chance of a life like that

I've been very focused on networking, coding, and cybersecurity recently but after 3-4 years of schooling and self teaching i just don't see myself pursuing this as a career.

I went from having some semblence of my shit together in high, school, graduating with honors in the top 10% of my class, 3.68 GPA, to a sucessful summer job where I felt happy and fulfilled, and now I'm pushing papers and solving textbook problems and taking notes and I hate it. I feel more alone than I ever have been, I lost contact with 2/3 of my friends, I'm still living at home and that's been rough too, everything is just falling apart because I can't get my fucking life back together. I'm miserable in my failing classes because its all theoretical, paper pushing so when I have to study or do homework it feels like I'm accomplishing nothing. I have to see a tangible product to my work to make it worthwhile, I've never been called lazy when I'm actually able to get through my depression, its just having the grit that I suck at. Regardless my parents are paying my tuition and I'm letting them down, so I'm torn between disappointing them by not going back next semester and just trying to find a job good enough to pay rent or buy a car to live in or going back and disappointing them with a failing grade and wasting money. I'm a complete idiot to have done this, I knew I would fail at it when I left high school and I allowed myself to believe I had a chance. I'm a manchild who can't manage time, the literal bare minimum of courses (I already had to drop one because of a miscommunication in the syllabus), I don't have a lot of friends, I don't do much with my passions/hobbies even.

2023-10-23,1698093417,Feeling lonely,"I don't want to come off as whiny or as someone who complains when I make this reddit post, but being a freshman and having no friends is more isolating than I thought it would be. In high school, I never ""felt lonely"" per se. My best friend who is still the closest person to me as of today, was always by my side and we did everything together, so the real feeling of loneliness never came to me. I was never into the party scene, big groups of people, and I was a wallflower at big functions, however, I was not introverted and always put in the effort when talking to people. Coming to a commuter school, mainly to save money and stay at home, feels like the biggest mistake, because it made me realize that I can't focus or feel comfortable knowing I feel completely lonely. (This might sound dramatic I'm sorry) I feel like I shouldn't be complaining because there are people who have felt this way their whole lives, and now i'm bitching about it because it finally hit me. 

I know that people here might have already formed groups from their high school, but sitting in the loud parts of the library make me feel embarrassed for myself I can't form these connections like other people. I've become good acquaintances with some people, but it always feels like a one time hello, and no real connections come out of it, and I am tired of these interactions. Even joining clubs, everyone somehow already knows each other, and it really hurts sitting there in a corner alone. (SO DRAMATIC LOL) I even try approaching people first, but it's like they couldn't even bother.

Like I said earlier, I don't really do parties (I'm sober and don't plan on ever getting drunk or high) but atp I would go to a party just to please someone to be their friend. I'm honestly not looking forward to halloween , my favorite holiday, knowing how lonely it would feel. It makes me wonder if I should have spent the money to dorm instead of going through this. I have a friend who dorms in a single room, and she's having trouble too. I thought it would be better as a commuter, to make friends though connections rather than having a set plan that creates immediate friendships, but I also don't want to be a financial burden to my parents.  

I know this is a very sad and dramatic post, but I want genuine advice. I'm so foreign to this feeling of loneliness. Please don't picture me as someone to complains about the small things. I've never been an out of the box person, and like I said, I've only ever had one real friend. I want to know how to get over this feeling.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17eufbq/feeling_lonely/
2023-10-23,1698080213,Graduating in 3 vs 3.5 Years,"Hello!

So after looking at the courses I have left to do for my major, I realized that I can graduate a semester early. I even realized that I can graduate a full year early if I just add an extra class each semester. Now, spending the most time here would be the most ideal, The main reason as to why I would consider graduating a full year is because I still I really would like some input on what I should do and any advice would be beneficial. 

3 1/2 yrs.

* Feel less FOMO if I stay the semester
* Would still be able to participate in organizations that I enjoy very much + more time with friends
* More time on the campus that I consider a home

3 yrs.

* Would save thousands of dollars (approx 10k+) compared to 3.5 yrs. (I am taking out loans and financing education myself.)
* Would get a head start on masters degree (2 year social work program which is costly)
* Would avoid the awkward break in the spring where I don't have school and at home
* I want to be done with school and am tired of the work
* Would avoid dealing with housing

I think at the end of the day, graduating in 3 years would be nice so I would not have to extend my schooling longer than I have to, especially because I have to go to grad school, and I can save thousands of dollars, but the main reason I want to do 3.5 is so I can do my clubs/organizations for one more semester and I know that college is not just academics.

We're about to take the midterm and I know for a fact that if he makes it too easy it's going to be curved down (yet he tells us not to worry about grades).

However, my whole life I have never really had a hobby I enjoyed up until now, which is finances. My passion for this subject is something I have never seen in myself. I want to have a degree that will allow me to have a broad range, like real estate, accounting, entrepreneurship, or an analyst, due to my indecisiveness.

Is there any other major that you all can recommend (finance, accounting, etc) for me to transition into now, or should I continue studying in BA?

Thanks everyone in advance.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17c1cp8/undergrad_who_cant_pick_a_major/

So is there anyone taking chemical engineering that thinks their college does really well with teaching?

Ive been in therapy for three years now because, to put it simply, somethings not right w/ my brain. Over those three years, Ive been diagnosed with a couple of different mental illnesses, but dont receive medication for any of them (by choice. Ive considered changing this decision, but I dont want to start medication while at college)

Recently, my mental health has completely spiraled and Im in the worst mental state ive ever been in. My therapist a few weeks ago suggested that I take a leave of absence so i can take some time to seek treatment and idk.. learn how to live again.

The problems im facing about the leave of absence revolve completely around my father. 

1) My older sister dropped out of college and he has (multiple times) disclosed his disappointment in her for doing so. Im scared of being a disappointment 

2) My dad is paying for my college. Im scared that taking a leave of absence will mean I have to pay by myself when I come back. While i know theres lots of people who pay by themselves, the opportunity to have it paid for in full is one i dont want to give up

3) (the big one) My dad doesnt believe in mental illness. He straight up told me I was lying about my experiences just to get attention. 

I cant even begin to imagine the conversation with him if i told him i wanted to take a leave of absence because of mental health. Honestly I fear that, not only would i lose his funding, but that id get kicked out of my family home as well. 

Its just scary and difficult because I know that this leave is what I need to get better (because ill actually be able to seek treatment and also take a break from the hell of college) but i feel like im trapped where i am out of fear",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17b83ep/wanting_to_take_a_leave_of_absence_but_terrified/

2023-10-17,1697510539,"Lack of Social ""Fabric"" In College?","First semester freshman here, and college feels so different from high school socially. There's like much less of a clique culture on campus, and it feels more like a city environment and less like a school environment in terms of socialization (if you get what I mean). There are huge age gaps here, and there's grown adults in some of my classes.

I'm halfway through this semester, and I haven't really found any friends to hang out with, which is expected as I'm only a freshman, but still a little weird. Everybody has their own schedule, unlike in high school, so I'm not forced to be with the same students everyday during classes and lunch back in high school, which I appreciate the freedom, but, man, it gets kind of lonely when there's no familiar faces around. It's so....inconsistent. I'm introverted, so I used to observe other students back in high school, like sitting down on the same lunch table everyday to see what wild shenanigans an underclassmen friend group would get into, or listen to what colleges my peers wanted to apply to.  Now, there's no sense of consistency--people aren't around the same places everyday, and so I just end up wandering around.

I know that it'll get better as I get into my upper division courses and people from my major are there, but I instantly feel that there's something about high school society that college has lost, I just don't know what it is.

My college feels too ""nice"" in comparison to high school--the cafeterias are modern, the gyms are exactly the same as regular city gyms, there's no uniqueness like those high school gyms that you know you'd never see outside of high schools, you know what I mean?

2023-10-14,1697250034,What are your college stories?,"Things that stand out in your mind as, ""Oh yeah, that happened."" 

My first day at big boy school, a group of transients were causing a ruckus in the square. I live in a place with a lot of homelessness. They were blasting music and drinking vodka, dancing around and screaming. I couldn't help but look over at them and one of them screamed at me, ""HEY WHO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE LOOKING AT? DON'T LOOK AT ME."" So at first I looked away. 

Then he screamed after me again, ""HEY! YOUR PERIPHERAL VISION COUNTS TOO!"" As hilarious as this statement is, this to me was largely untenable (and I've been fightin nearly my whole adult life (I'm 30) and a part of me will always respond to fightiness) so I looked back at him and shouted, ""Actually I am going to look wherever I want to."" 

He quite literally bumrushed me and got in my face. He had meth mouth and sad eyes. He was an inch away from my face but to me he seemed quite frightened and was really just trying to scrape respect from any place he could find it. I've done some work with homeless in the system and it's really horrifying how little humanity they're treated with. 

I looked him in the eye and reached my hand out to him, and said, ""Hi, my name is \[redacted\].""

He looked at my hand a moment before taking into his own and shaking it. He said, ""My name is DEATH."" 

I said, ""Well, hello death. It's very nice to meet you. What are you doing today?""

He paused and said, ""Today... today I'm going to go murder the man that killed my wife."" 

And I said, ""Holy shit, I've met you on one of the biggest days of your life. What's your story?"" 

He told me the whole background with what happened, then he said he'd escaped 20 mental institutions and all he wants is to help people that are suffering with their thoughts. 

I told him that he can't do that if he's in jail for murder and he tentatively agreed. Then I told him I hope he knows he's much more normal than he thinks he is. He told me he was glad to meet me and I told him I was glad to meet him. Death was the first friend I met at school. 

The second thing that happened at college was last weekend I went to the Library basement so I could read the poetry I write on the desks down there to see if anyone had responded. But when went down there I heard what sounded like a nearly empty spray bottle being forcefully sprayed. A ""scttttch, stttch, sctttch"" sound. I perused to investigate, and as I rounded the corner I beheld a most amazing sight. A young man in his underwear with earbuds in with his hands outstretched above him as he looked at his laptop and was doing some kind of breathing exercise. The sort of quick forced breathing a mother in labor does before birthing out her baby. I made eye contact with the silly fuck and he just kept on ""sctttch""ing like I wasn't even there. I love him and I hope he remembers me.

2023-10-14,1697245957,more major related decision crises,"I posted about this on here recently (since deleted) but im back again

I'm currently a declared computer science major but I've realized that I don't even like it

There a handful of humanities type majors (econ&amp;history, polisci, classics) i think are just so interesting i could cry. like i know deep down that's really where i belong

problem is, i don't want to be poor lol

every person i've presented this dilemma to (well, most of them) have basically suggested some variation of ""at least keep CS as a second major"" but at my school, CS is one of the heftier majors even when ur not in the engineering school, takes up more credits, and plus i just straight up don't like it

i couldn't even tell you what i want to do when i graduate because i have a very poor understanding of what careers exist beyond CS/law/med/people who do... whatever finance bros do

i'd love to be a professor and do research but i know academia is about to hit a cliff

i'd also love to work in foreign policy in some way but i have no idea what that entails or what's necessary to get into it (sounds like the kind of thing you need connections for, and i'm painfully introverted - i've been trying to put myself out there more but it's kind of making me less rather than more social, i'm starting to think i actually have social anxiety but yk)

i just want to simultaneously be happy and make money lol

i'm at a ""prestigious"" uni with opportunities abound and it seems like if i could make something out of one of the ""harder to get into"" career paths anywhere, it would be here

i know i love writing, i love reading, and i think i'd like doing research, although i'm a freshman and still not sure exactly what that entails

help me, what do i do

btw i'm planning to at least attain conversational fluency in both spanish and mandarin at college, probably minoring in spanish. i still intend to minor in data science, and if i didn't major in cs, i'd possibly minor in it?

any advice?

anyone know of jobs that exist for someone who starts shaking and crying when they look at geopolitical maps or read classic literature but is probably not cut out for the sexy google internship? is it cs or die?

and by ""i want to make money"" i mean i want to make enough bank that i can ""retire"" fairly early in my life to a humble cabin in the middle of nowhere with three cats and write historical fiction/fantasy novels for the remainder of my life. no mansion or fancy car or anything like that. on this note i have been looking into trying to grind my way into a top law school bcuz i have no life outside of writing books and playing video games, i am not afraid of late hours or the Grind, i like legal puzzles and writing, and some of those lawyers make BANKKK and that's really all i want. i don't think i'll get ultimate job satisfaction in any path for that kind of money, i just want to not be miserable and have reasonably fulfilling and intellectually stimulating work to do",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/177dvq6/more_major_related_decision_crises/

I know that college isn't for everyone. Since my sophomore year, I knew that I didn't want to go to college. It is talked about so much that I felt the pressure of it. I only told my mom that I didn't want to go to college. The reason why is because I have my own personal plan that I know is going to work out (yes, I sound delusional). Even if I had to go to college, my major would have been in Culinary. Besides, I'm already doing Culinary at my high school and our chef said that Culinary in college is the same thing in high school. Plus, I have my ServSafe certification, making it easier for me to get a job in the culinary field. Anyways, she told me that I need to go to college to get a degree because I wasn't going to get a job without one. For context, she is a nurse and had to get her degree in the medical field. I told that I know that I am going to be successful without college and without a degree, something that a teacher in freshman year told me. She also told me to keep my options open which made it more complicated for me because now I'm thinking what should I do.

2023-10-09,1696877767,No motivation or discipline to do assignments or study.,"Good Evening,

WARNING: Messy and out of order thoughts below.

I (22M) have come to the realization that MAYBE (again MAYBE) college just is not for me. During high school I graduated with an okay GPA (5. something weighted), did well in all my classes, never had to study to pass my classes. 

Come around college, the first school I went to was an overpriced school for becoming a pilot. It was hell, took class like calculus for aviation and barely passed while studying my ass off. Due to many life circumstances, after a year of being at that university and 120K down the drain, I was suspended from that school due to poor grades. A semester later I returned to college, but now to a cheap no-name community college. I was able to get my GPA back-up as I had to get an AA, but now that I am super duper junior on the second half of my junior year, it is happening again. 

My motivation is essentially none. I am doing a B.S. in IT &amp; Systems and the classes I am taking are just mentally draining me to the point where I just do not try, listen to lectures, study, nothing. I am in school on paper but not mentally. I work a low level IT job full time so by the time I get home at 5pm, the last thing i want to do is spend another 7 hours doing something I do not want to do. My courses require mathematics and programming (both of which I do not understand why I am required to take, my program is an IT degree, not CS degree, but that is besides the point).

I cant force myself to sit there and learn something like calculus or JavaScript when it is not something that I am naturally capable of, it just does not click in my brain and never has no matter the time I put in. In the same amount of time it takes a student to complete these assignments, it would take me 10x longer. So you may ask, well why did you take this degree in the first place? Because I thought that IT meant messing with networking and managing enterprise software and hardware (which is the observation I am making on my current job anyways). Not only this, but if I am going to get stuck doing something for the rest of life, I would rather it be on computers than some brain dead physical job. I do not like to do many things except play video games, stay up to date on latest tech, and read Reddit/Quora/Wiki/. I did not know I had to learn things like Calc 1, Data Structures, and Discreet Math, for a topic like IT. Typically I was told the courses aforementioned are reserved for CS students typically. 

I plan on transferring to a different local college next semester, one where I looked at the curriculum and looks like the classes are supposed to be easier and MUCH less focused on programming/maths and more focused on the networking side of things. But I am afraid the same thing will happen. I always just become tired and un-motivated because it just feels like so much work for maybe a remote chance I get a job in the future that pays me a livable wage.

I am honestly just so fed up with everything. I am tired, I want to be able to live my life and do the hobbies I enjoy, instead of being forced to find a career that most fits me at such a young age. 

If anyone has any experiences they could share, please do so. Feels like I am at an all time low recently and I am not even consciously aware of it. At this point, it feels like the only reason I am in college just to keep my public/private student loans in deferment.

The only hope I have of scraping by with a C is to get 100% on all my exams, quizzes, and homeworks which is unlikely. Unfortunately, I wont be able to take any of major specific classes for next semester unless I pass calc first. I already completed all my ged eds save for one (which Im currently taking) so if I retake calc next semester (spring) it would be the only class Id have that semester.

I just feel like such a failure and cant imagine how to break the news to my parents that I may have to delay graduation due to my own negligence.

Edit: Im taking Calc 1 and the class is fully online with no class meetings or recorded lectures. Every week there is homework posted on MyOpenMath and the quiz or exam is released on Thursdays and due on Sunday by midnight. Were expected to take the assessments on examinity for proctoring to prevent cheating. 

MyOpenMath is structured so that the quiz tab is lowkey hidden compared to the homework. The link to the homework is clear in blue, but the link for the quiz takes 2 clicks to access so I tend to overlook when its due and dont check examity to complete the weeks quiz. However, the thing with examity is that it doesnt let you take the test if youre an hour away from the deadline (midnight). I found this out the hard way when I logged to take my exam (worth more than quiz) at 11 pm and wasnt able to access it which caused me to not take it and get a 0. I assume this was a fluke or an issue on my end but it happened with the second exam as well. 

In case youre wondering why Im doing math tests so late at night its because my little brother is super noisy and doesnt like sleeping alone.

2023-11-05,1699226823,Horrible time after college. Can any relate?,"After graduating I didn't get a job like I thought, after applying for everything I could find.
It was really degrading to see nobody would hire me, when I knew I would provide value. For the past three years I felt like university would be my ticket out of hell, but it didn't work out that way.

By the time I graduated I was on top of the world, I felt like the best I've ever been mentally and physically.

Sadly, after that I had to go back to the only places I could get hired, and work in miserable manual labour.

After 1 year of the worst job I've ever had. I had to stop working due to a bad back injury which is still not better 1 year after I quit. The job I worked was meant to be an gap year before I went back for postgraduate studies. 
Instead I was so overworked I developed severe chronic fatigue that I could barely get through a day, but I kept enduring because I don't know my own limits and I've always been a crazy hard worker.

So the past year I've been on unemployment, I used up all my savings, and I'm basically disabled. 
It has been horrible and the past 7 months I've been in the darkest pits of human misery imaginable. 
I don't know how I have refrained from suicide, but I won't give up.

Now, I am thinking to try to transitions into Tech after I get a Comptia cert. But my future is very unclear. I can't afford to go back to university.

It's a shame, but if I never had that job that injured me, I would probably already have my postgraduate degree right now, and I wouldn't be disabled. It has really got me down very very low.

(It could help to mention that I have hard times focusing)
I am a college freshman (law) and I hate what Im studying.

 I wasnt interested in law, but it looked like the only academic subject that I could pick. I thought Id get interest once in there, but I like it even less than before (the atmosphere, people, way of talking, organisation&).

The only reason I stay is because a degree gets you more choices in life (professionally speaking), and after not really having the choice on what to study, I dont want the same to happen the rest of my career.

In highschool, I could at some point put myself to work because it was either interesting or at least not VERY interesting, but now, I find it actively uninteresting and cant even read my lessons for long.

My parents have done too munch to offer me a comfortable life, and are happy that Im supposed to spend a year studying in an other country (which I dont like but again, double diploma= more choice) but I dont know if I have the level to.
I dont want to disappoint them.

Because of that, I really want to finish to both make them proud and to leave this field that I dont like.

So the question is: **how do you put yourself to work on something you could care less about ?**

We also sit relatively close to each other, I'm in the first row and she's in the second. She's also relatively taller than I am, personally I feel it might almost be comical how much taller she is than me (I'm about 5'7½"" she's got a solid couple of inches over me, if not 6' or somwhere close, but honestly i kind of like that about her). She's also British, English I'm pretty sure judging from her accent. Honestly I don't know what I should do, or how i could start a conversation.

2023-11-04,1699081163,professors and ai detectors,so i just started my 8 week comm class and the professor has made it super clear in her introduction videos she uses ai checkers and has caught students using ai before and they got in trouble. i dont use ai but i started using ai checkers just to make sure my work isnt coming up as red flags and it is. the thing is most of the work assigned is 200 min word discussion posts or mini essays which just discuss the chapter. i use my normal language and reference some of the words from the chapter if its in the question. all of it comes up as ai detected so ive started messing up the grammar by miss using comas because im scared but we get graded on grammar. i literally spend a good 3 hours after doing the initial homework trying to make sure that most of the ai checkers say its fine when its MY WORK. i already use google docs for the history just in case but ive seen some people say theyre professors dont care about that,college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17ng113/professors_and_ai_detectors/

is me. all this said I have 3 main questions/advice i could use.

1. is there anything at all i can do to lower these costs? ive already begged for more money (they gave me $4k more in aid woohoo), applied to a million scholarships, and have a work study and a part time job.

2.  realistically, will i be able to land a good enough job in my field after school to pay off 160k in debt without completely setting myself up for financial ruin? or should i just go ahead and transfer back to my subpar but still decent state school (UGA)?

3. music is my passion and my real dream is to work in the music/entertainment business. i know it will be much more fulfilling than working in an econ/corporate/government environment, but the pay on average across the music industry field is just sooo much less unless you really make it big or grind up the corporate ladder (for bigger publishing and record label companies). does it make any sense to pursue this career path, or should i just focus in school for a steadier job? i know people be saying pursue your dreams or else youll regret it later in life, but i feel like id also regret having hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt lol.

The reason Im asking this is because Im worried that Im just not going to learn or be challenged at my school.

For context, I went to my safety school, DePauw, because they offered me a full ride as well as paying for a semester abroad, pretty good deal compared to paying 20-30k a year at UMich. However, the classes Im taking are just not challenging, its just a lot of busy work. In econ Im learning the same things I did in HS, in French the 300 level course is way below my level because the next hardest course I could take is the capstone course which Im not allowed to take (I have to take 3 more French courses in order to get to that and do a minor, so it basically just means slogging through lower level courses that wont help me at all). What Id like to do with French is get it out of the way so I can learn a different language, as I can already speak decent French so its more so about having a piece of paper that says I can do it. In my first year seminar we read and then go to class and discuss, then write an essay every few weeks, same thing for my history course. even though its about a topic Im interested in, this just isnt helping me, doesnt help that a lot of the other students dont care and never participate in class.

Im awaiting my PSAT score and a practice ACT score, Ill take the one that counts in February. All standardized/state tests have placed me well above average in English and average/occasionally slightly below in math.

Yesterday I opened up my computer and saw that I received an extremely low score(15.5/100, the average  score was 60)in a programming midterm exam. To be fair, that was my fault as I did not balance my time well and spent too much time on more difficult assessments instead of going through exam content. It is a second year course too. I got frustrated and upset. In the beginning, I thought about just keeping quiet and not bursting out but then a few minutes I couldn't take it so I told my parents. Then, I cried in my room really terribly to the point that everyone can hear. This made my Father stressed and he got extremely angry about the fact and told me he won't speak to me for one week to make me learn that parents have their own issues too and cannot get stressed about adult children (Tbh, I have complained to him and expressed frustration immaturely a lot of times over the past year about my low scores and low GPA). That is my fault and I do not know how to cope. I feel angry back towards my Father but those feelings of anger do not make sense when I was wrong here.

 Honestly, complaining to them has been a coping mechanism for me and I do not know any other way to react to such low results other than being emotional about it. I have too much stress over this issue and that I have to at least pass this course.

2023-10-31,1698769469,Failed semester due to insatisfaction,"I failed the semester.

Context is key here. I'm 21. I'm from a small country in which college isn't like in the US.
You go for a class one day. You do homework through online modules. That's it. It's a very distant college experience.

Life has become boring to me. Or rather, insatisfactory. Part of me wishes I could hang out with other people. Interact with others in class. Meet up on weekends and stuff. Just the bare minimum. Anything other than staying in my room playing videogames. I feel myself wasting away. So, driving 30 minutes for a 3 hour class with no social interaction. Or logging in online to do boring homework. It just doesn't sound appealing. And I know not everything in life is fun. But something must be. Back in school, I didn't have this problem. Sure, homework was borderline exvessive and not all classes were interesting. But there was a trade-off. People. People that talk. Classmates to spend time with. To do homework and projects together. 14 year old me would kill me but, I miss group assignments. That was enough for me. Enough for me to put in the effort. It was a good trade-off and my last years of school were challenging, but also beautiful.

 A bit of context here is where I live: People here are not the best at being social. Usually the problem is that one is too introverted. For me, the problem is being too extroverted. People don't like socializing. They get too awkward or defensive if you approach them. So that's kind of what makes this problem. We are very closed people over here and everyone lives inside their own homes all the time or they are party animals that go to discos. There are obviously good traits in everyone, though. But, I'm tired. I've been trying the whole year to look for ""a place"" somewhere where people can be more... open. And I've found out, there isn't in this small city. So I'm changing fields.

I'm moving to a dorm in the US next year. I've always loved it at dorms. Always made friends without problems. I gotta wait until summer since that's when freshman usually enter as adviced by my counsellor. That's too damn long. But anyways. Life moves on. Gotta try again and keep trying.

2023-10-31,1698718297,Are you an adult thinking about going to college for the first time? Save a pile of money with CLEP and self study,"If you are an adult thinking about going to college for the first time, it's likely you have a lot of doubts about whether you can even do the work. The doubts get stronger the further you get from high school. If you weren't a great student in high school, you are probably even more concerned.  
  
Try college out for free by taking CLEP credits. CLEP is short for College-Level Examination Program. Basically, you self-study and then you go and take a proctored exam at either an exam center or university testing center. Usually these exams are about $93 to take plus the local exam fee which is usually around $20 or so. The list of subjects is here: https://clep.collegeboard.org/clep-exams  
  
The big issue with CLEP is that you often don't know what CLEP exams your local college will accept until after you take the exam and apply. In other words, you could spend the $93 and have nothing to show for it depending on your local university's policy.  
  
You can mitigate that risk by using free CLEP study materials at Modern States. Website here: https://modernstates.org/  
  
Depending on funding, they offer free CLEP exam certificates if you use their study materials and completely study for the exam. That's a free $93 exam. You just have to pay the local testing fee and sometimes they will even reimburse that. The available CLEP study material is listed here: https://modernstates.org/course/  
  
Another caveat is that often colleges will only accept credits you earned prior to enrollment. In other words, if you sign up for college and then take CLEP, some colleges will only accept the CLEP you had completed before enrollment. If you are already enrolled, speak to a guidance counselor about whether or not you can add CLEP credits.

2023-10-30,1698682486,Whatre some careers you could go into with a BA in Math?,"I had a subpar GPA due to some personal issues (though my major GPA is still decent) so Im not considering a Masters at the moment, maybe after a few years of working. But it seems that most suggested careers for math majors either require higher-level maths or extensive domain-knowledge in another field. For example, being an economist requires economics, actuarial science requires the actuary exams, data science and statistics jobs strongly prefer graduate degrees, engineering and other related areas require applied math (among other things), and I have no interest in anything related to academia. So what options do I even have?

For additional context, Im finishing up my final year at a pretty good public university in the USA. My major is math (no applied math option at my school though the classes Ive taken have definitely leaned towards it) and I have a minor in philosophy. Ive also taken the foundational courses for statistics and optimization (introductory statistics 1-2, probability theory, statistical theory, machine learning, numerical analysis, linear optimization, mathematical modeling, advanced linear algebra) and have decent coding/CS knowledge (proficiency in Java up to data structures level, proficiency in Python, particularly in terms of numerical methods and machine learning, R, Excel, and some databases).

Right now it seems like my best bet is to start taking the actuary exams (I can do P and FM before I graduate). Or to self-study mathematical finance and hope to break into that field. Data science and SWE seem to be out of reach as theyre competitive and require more advanced topics in statistics and CS, respectively.",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17jx20f/whatre_some_careers_you_could_go_into_with_a_ba/

She has complained about the dining hall food.  She has always been a picky eater, with some sensory issues regarding texture.  She is also vegetarian (but not vegan).

I want to put together a box of non-perishable food that she can eat in her dorm room.  Well, by non-perishable, I mean its a 12-hour road trip back home, so nothing refrigerated or frozen, but bread and produce would be OK.

She only has a microwave and a mini-fridge, which she shares with one roommate.  

They are not allowed any other small appliances&except for a blender.  I plan to buy her a small compact blender for Christmas.

What foods should I include in her box?

Shell be driving, not flying, so a reasonable box should fit in her trunk.

2023-10-30,1698624061,Looking for direction as a Computer Science student,"I want to begin this post by saying I'm a 25 year old financially independent college-student who enrolled into a 4-year university in Fall 2022. I have my associates for a liberal arts degree, and started to code as a hobby shortly after receiving it. I ended up enjoying it enough that I wanted to pursue it as a career and decided to enroll in my town's university (KU). This past year has been one of the most difficult and confusing parts of my life and I'm starting to question whether or not the option of a 4-year degree is suitable for me.

I know it is small compared to others, but I have accrued over $8,000 in debt and I have little to show for it in terms of Computer Science knowledge. I've been maintaining an A in my comp sci classes such as Programming 1 and 2, but I've severely struggled with other required classes such as Calculus 3 and Physics. I've dropped my Physics class last semester and seriously doubt I am going to pass my Calc 3 course this semester. I was also diagnosed with ADHD last month and am in the process of receiving accommodations.

However even with accommodations, my poor performance this past year has taken a serious blow to my mental health and confidence in obtaining my degree by Fall 2025. I have taken barely any computer science classes and to be honest, the amount of time and money spent on concepts adjacent to Computer Science seem to distract me from time I could have spent independently studying or pursuing a bootcamp. My performance will almost certainly affect my financial aid and add even more stress of barely being able to afford living expenses.

I am at the point of feeling so burnt out I'm not even sure that continuing in a University would be a good idea financially and for my own mental health. I'm barely able to see friends anymore and I'm under constant stress of being able to afford necessities.  Is a 4-year degree in Computer Science really necessary in the field to be successful?  I am not trying to rise to the tippy top but just want to live a comfortable lifestyle without constantly living paycheck to paycheck.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17jge2u/looking_for_direction_as_a_computer_science/

All of the classes at ASU are accelerated, which is honestly fine. The workload can be a little overbearing but thats not why I had to withdraw from any classes. I was taking summer classes earlier this year, and withdrew from one of them because I had family stuff going on that completely distracted me from school and at the time I was also working overtime every single week at Starbucks so I had fallen so behind I couldnt possibly get a passing grade. And then the next time I withdrew from my classes was because of the same reasons- my family issues and work schedule prevented me from being able to be as present as I should have been in my classes and they moved so fast that I had fallen extremely behind. Now, Im about to have to withdraw from a class because of financial reasons. This class requires a textbook, which wasnt cheap- but I got it. But once you buy the textbook you also have to buy access to the workbook that all of our assignments are in as well as an additional fee to be able to talk to our professor which is a mandatory assignment. Its only 2 weeks into the course, but Im already super behind because I cannot afford the textbooks that I need to do half of the assignments. Because of the way the class and schedule is set up, I only found out about all the extra stuff I had to buy after my groceries and rent and buying the textbook for the other class Im taking as well as 1 of the 3 required for this class. Its only 2 weeks into the class, out of 6- but no late work is accepted and I currently have a 30. Multiple assignments are due tonight which will drop my grade lower, and Im unsure if I should just drop the class and take it next semester and make sure I have enough money for it- or if I should instead try to salvage my grade and buy the textbook after my next pay day.

Ive had the routine of taking four classes a semester which has been working out for me fairly well as Ive been keeping up with my grades. As a result from a mistake thats entirely my own, I registered earlier on for a course that started later in the semester and was expected to be accelerated. I didnt mind at all because I knew what I signing up for. But I didnt calculate how difficult one of my classes would be until now. 

I have one course in particular that has been very time consuming. I tend to dedicate a lot of my brain to it so I can have a shot at a good grade (professor is a hard grader). Anyways, once this last course of mine started, which is sociology, I looked through the modules and realized there were five essays assigned to be submitted until mid December. The first two had six days between due dates, then there is a three week break period between the third, forth, and fifth essays which each also had six days between due dates. 

Normally, I dont think this would be a big deal, however, this one course contains a lot of thought provoking assignments, hence why it takes so long to do them. I have a larger essay due for this course toward the end of November as well as other course assignments to fit in that are also slightly time consuming. Additionally, theres finals I have to worry about. My concern is that Im going to overwork myself and turn in mediocre work that wont receive a good grade.

For the longest time I wanted to be a teacher, but lately Ive been questioning if its something I want to do. Ive taken probably 20+ career tests/college major quizzes. I usually get education, healthcare, or social sciences. 

My current major is English Education but I took a literature class last semester and realized I dont like it, so Im taking some education classes right now because I thought I might want to be an elementary school teacher. I realized I dont want to graduate with a degree in elementary education, because it feels very limiting to one area, and I dont feel itll give me a lot of skills to build on. 

I went to an advising and registration night and told the staff I wanted to talk about different majors and what might be a good fit. They asked me what my current major is and I told them. They did my degree audit and within 5 minutes had a list of classes they said I should register for, then sent me on my way. I feel absolutely hopeless. I asked for help and I cant even get it.

I am at my wits end at this point. Im ready to drop out of school because I am so overwhelmed by all this. I dont want to quit school but I do not know what I want to do and it feels like Ill never figure it out.

You would have people like me who are just out of high school and others who are fully grown adults. It's common to see middle-aged people in community college. Now, there's nothing wrong with that, but it just makes it really hard for me to make new friends with the environment I'm in.

I've already joined an org in my nearest state university, but it's really far from my house and even farther from the school I go to, so it makes it difficult to keep up with everything. I also have a small friend group from high school that I regularly go to class with, but we recently had a falling out and I'm now left with no friends to go to. On top of that, I do have a girlfriend but she goes to school 300 miles away and is living her own life right now, so she doesn't always have the time to talk to me.

2023-10-13,1697206308,Roommate issues. What do I do?,"I recently got a new roommate (Lets call her Jen) and shes suddenly avoiding me. Jen is a peculiar roommate who is never home and is always out studying. She does not contribute to household chores other than doing her own dishes (not even replacing the toilet paper after shes used it all). I, on the other hand tend to put away the clean dishes, clean the house 2x a week when Im working from home (vacuum, mop, wipe down surfaces, reorganize the couch, etc., all of which I purchased an abundant amount of supplies for). Our housing assignment was rushed as she claims to desperately need housing and begged me to take her so we set basic rules such as letting each other know when we have guests, pets were ok, etc.  I didnt expect her to not do her part in the house. My boyfriend sometimes visits and brings his dog to stay the night. The dog is a Husky shepherd mix so he sheds quite a bit. I try to keep him in my room to minimize shedding and I vacuum the apartment twice over to make sure all of the fur is gone and clean up any surfaces.

Over the weekend Jen texts me to thank me for cleaning the house before I left for the weekend (I didnt do my usual cleaning tha week because I was busy and she left a dirty stove/countertop) and that she had to vacuum/mop her room because of the of the fur that gathered into her room, its all over the couch (also mine and she does not use), and all over the kitchen surfaces. Sometimes she lets the dog out of my room when my boyfriend and I go out so Im not surprised if it went into her room as sometimes I find him there chilling with her but the other complaints are invalid. She asked that I no longer bring pets into our apartment as the fur made her feel uncomfortable. Although I was upset over it but said sure since my boyfriend is going on a long work trip and wont be visiting for a quite some time but I did remind her that had already agreed and previously discussed with her that I was watching my parents maltese for a week as theyre on vacation but I will keep him on a tighter leash than the shedding husky. I then mentioned that next time if she had an issue with me, to discuss it in person as I felt a bit offended that she had to wait until I left to text me about the issue. And she responded that she thought it was an urgent matter.

After I came back from my weekend trip I began to notice shes been avoiding me throughout the week. No longer using the dish rack we share but washing her dishes and leaving them to dry in a cabinet, removing her stuff from the bathroom, taking her shes from the shoe rack, just hiding everything from me as if Im the plague. She wakes up after I leave for work, comes home super late (midnight or so), and talks on the phone very loudly all the time.

Im struggling in my chemistry class and I dont really understand why. I have always been good at science its been my easiest subject for years. Im a pretty stem heavy major as my forensic science major requires me to take a year of basic chemistry and organic chemistry. 
For background I took Chemistry when I was in high school and I absolutely loved it, I loved my teacher I loved the material and I did well in the class. I study hard for all the exams I rewrite notes, I go over practice problems, I go to tutoring sessions when I can. 
Basically how the grading system for our chemistry classes at my university works is that there are certain objectives each of which connect to the main teaching points of the unit, the objectives have different parts but on the exams if you get even one part of an objective wrong the whole question is wrong. The professors also all meet and compare mistakes students made on the exam to decide if those mistakes will be overlooked or not. You can forget one unit in your final answer and the whole thing is wrong. Although I expected college to be harder than high school I guess I wasnt expecting such strict standards. 
Anyway, I havent done well on the exams they have given so far in the semester and Im scared Im falling behind. Im even worried that Im not cut out for my major although I really enjoy it.

2023-11-06,1699311852,Advice on potential major/career switch,"


Hi all. Im currently a junior at a highly ranked business school, and Im currently recruiting for consulting/marketing jobs. Although Im actively recruiting for these roles, Ive never really liked business nor the prospect of working in a corporate environment. My choice of going to school as a business major was in-part due to some external family pressure and internal pressure to find something stable. My school is also very well-known for business and I felt a sort of obligation to major in it for that reason.

Ive become increasingly depressed and anxious as a direct result of going through with my major and recruiting for the industry. Living in a major city has also contributed to this, and I cant see myself being able to handle the hustle environment for much longer. I have never felt like myself in my current academic/professional situation, and this feeling has turned my outlook on life to be increasingly negative in the past few months. Naturally my therapist, along with my friends and family, have strongly encouraged me to consider other career options, which has led me to give such options serious thought. I dont mind the prospect of making less money I dont aspire to own or rent things beyond modest means. Going to school for an extra year also wont be an issue, as most of my school so far has been covered via scholarships.

Ive been seriously considering becoming a history/education major and pursuing teaching as a career. I am far aware that teaching has its drawbacks, but the idea of being able to engage with a true passion of mine while doing work that actually means something (to me) seems much preferable to working in a job without that sense of personal impact (Im not saying corporate jobs are meaningless fwiw, just that they dont satisfy my sense of purpose i want from my work). 

I know there are a million next steps from here& Ill see what my career advisor has to say, but I would appreciate any candid input from you guys.

Edit: current plan is to continue recruiting for marketing/consulting until I find an internship for summer 2024 (which would eventually extend to a full-time position). Would ideally have an offer by early December, which would give me at least a cushion if I decide to switch into something else.",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17pfwqy/advice_on_potential_majorcareer_switch/

It is also said that as long as the college is accredited, there is no real difference between an online and a traditional degree.

However, with uni, my whole life changed. I feel like I became stumped. I don't understand things in class, am so lazy, and can't read before class. In fact, I get left behind in the first week.

It is not entirely my fault (I think),"I've been slowly getting a bad cold for a couple of days now and was up all night with intense coughing and aches and pains. I emailed my professor at 6 a.m. because I knew I was not going to be well enough to attend our 1-4 p.m. class. I wrote in the email that I understood that we had an online, in-person quiz today and that I would make myself available whenever it worked best for him, assuming that he needed to proctor or schedule a proctor. I don't hear from him the entire day, but notice he must be on his computer because I see him uploading other coursework to our student portal. At 1 pm exactly, I received a notification that the quiz link was shared with me. I did not open the quiz because I did not think I was allowed to take it. At 1:05, he emailed me that I must start the quiz right that second and that I must submit it by 1:30 p.m. or I will receive a zero. Knowing how quizzes work in the past with this professor, I know that once he enters the classroom on quiz day he logs onto his laptop and tells everyone to be prepared to open the quiz link the moment the clock hits 1 p.m. and we have 30 minutes to take the quiz. Since he emailed me later, I was already at a disadvantage starting a 30-question quiz 5 minutes later than everyone else. I was also caught off guard because I was nervous to submit it even the slightest bit past 1:30 p.m. and had no clue that I would be taking the quiz right then in there. I understand that it would be a possibility, but I just found it a bit unprofessional notifying me the moment I needed to begin. My issue is what if I was not actively checking my email, or if my sickness prevented me from taking the quiz? I did not disclose the extent of my illness so how was he to know I was able to complete the quiz at that time? 

By the end of the quiz, I was filling in random answers because I was running out of time. Although I submitted the quiz at 1:28 p.m. (because I was nervous about submitting it too late), I did very poorly. I received a 58%. Additionally, this professor does not have any section within his syllabus that has the course grading/weights for assignments (he also does not include any information about missing classes/exams for sickness, etc.). Considering that we are almost at the end of the semester and there is a total of 3 assignments/quizzes and 3 more to take, I figure that this quiz weighs high and will completely ruin my good grade.

i am a freshman in community college part time and only take two classes. i want to leave one because this class requires me to think more (it is statistics) and i recently lost a family member that delayed me big time- slowing down my original pace, etc.

my statistics professor is.. okay, i guess. she's not good but she's not great either. 3.5 on rmp. i am currently studying for an exam that has so much material in it that i've been confusing terms in it all the time. the exam is this week, but whats also due this week is an entire lesson that's not included in this exam, but the next.
i am suspected to have a learning disability, so all this material has been overwhelming me and i can't keep up. it doesn't help that my professor has been limiting us from using calculators, requiring we use the very long and time consuming formulas that are in her lectures. this is getting to be very hard to learn and memorize.

i want to withdraw because i know i'm not gonna pass the upcoming exam, i just know it. i'd rather have a W than an F. i was told by financial aid office that my financial aid won't be affected, but it puts me in financial aid warning, and brings my completion grade down to a 50% rather than the 67% that is required to keep financial aid going. i also need to maintain a 2.0 GPA, otherwise i go into suspension. (the 6 credits minimum also isn't a worry, as the composition class i'm taking covers that.)

i have broke down multiple times over my situation because nobody has actually properly helped me in my personal life, so i'm turning to reddit. do you guys think i should just withdraw to save myself the trouble? i'm not a bad student, i had plans to finish both classes with passing grades but one class got to be too much, and i have no doubts i'll pass my next classes, as i only need one mathematics credit. any help is great, thanks.",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17k7axj/needing_help_regarding_withdrawals_urgent/

2023-10-29,1698608000,Choosing Between IT and Philosophy: Seeking Career Guidance,"Hello, I'm currently 19 and just started my first year at university a few months ago. I find myself facing a significant predicament and I'm hoping to seek advice!!

&amp;#x200B;

The main challenge I'm facing revolves around my hatred of mathematics, a crucial component in technology-related fields. Conversely, I have an unwavering passion for philosophy, politics, psychology, sociology, and all things related to the social sciences. I can easily dedicate 8 hours to  reading and continuously write on even the most mundane topics in these subjects. Yet, the mere thought of engaging with math for an hour fills me with dread, leading me to prefer delving into a political theory textbook instead.

My current degree is a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, but I'm contemplating a shift to a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy and Politics. What's making me feel so apprehensive is the potential lack of a secure career path and financial stability that might accompany this change. I acknowledge that no degree guarantees immediate job prospects; success demands hard work and practical experience. Unfortunately, Arts degrees often carry the stigma of leading to ambiguous career paths.

I can probably endure the annoying discrete math, calculus, and programming classes. However, the end reward seems like a well-paying job in the tech sector, which I'm uncertain that I genuinely care about. While the idea of working remotely, programming, and earning a comfortable income sounds amazing, I'm unsure if that's the lifestyle I envision for myself. What truly makes me happy is the notion of becoming an educator, lawyer, or professor, where I can engage with people directly and make a meaningful difference. I see myself as an artistic individual, drawn to literature and the social sciences, rather than being confined to a corporate programming job for the foreseeable future. Even a master's in argumentation studies sounds like something I would love doing or even law school.

Perhaps my concerns stem from stereotypical assumptions associated with these academic paths. It's plausible that I could carve a path where I pursue a teaching career while also having the flexibility to explore opportunities in the technology sector. I just don't know if that's possible if I take all Philosophy and Poli Sci courses the next 4 years.

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm a 19-year-old student torn between enduring an I.T degree or changing my major to philosophy and politics. I'm worried about future job options, as arts degrees can seem uncertain, but I am willing to put in the work into anything as long as I like it. Unsure if a tech job is for me, dreaming of teaching or law instead. Trying to find a middle ground between my passions and practicality.

2023-10-27,1698389293,Im actually too dumb for Computer Science,"I'm currently enrolled in an introductory Python programming course at university, and I'm struggling so bad right now. While most people I know find this course easy, I'm finding it extremely difficult and often feel lost. I work through the zyBooks assignments each week, taking my time to ensure I grasp the material, yet my classmates who speed through them seem to have a much better understanding of the homework and lab work.

Speaking of the lab, I frequently rely on my lab partners, and since we rotate partners often, it can be somewhat embarrassing to sit quietly, pretending to work on the code while I daydream, and they complete the entire assignment. It's not because I want to do this, but I just get confused and give up a couple times before fully checking out. Almost everyone I talk to in this class either took AP Computer Science in high school or just quickly grasps new concepts. The pace of this course is crazy. We're introduced to concepts like nested loops, arrays, etc., and suddenly we're expected to be experts in these functions, knowing how and when to implement them and understanding their impacts on other python functions. I currently have a B but that's only because I've  resorted to cheating on homework and relying on others in the lab just to get by.

The most frustrating aspect of all of this is not just how challenging it is for me, but how effortless it appears to be for others. I slacked off throughout high school, and I feel like I haven't developed the skills needed to handle these demanding college courses. It's disheartening, especially because this is just the introductory level. I'm determined not to change my major; I want to graduate with a STEM degree, and the idea of becoming a software engineer and the potential salary are motivating factors.

Despite the difficulties, I want to mention that I am learning a lot. It's just that I'm learning at a slower pace and definitely not learning as much compared to others.  My primary concern is how I'll fare in the next course, data structures. I know it's a crucial class, and if I'm struggling now, I fear my chances of success might be slim.

2023-10-27,1698365259,"Kind of over the undergrad life, but feel bad about it","I'm going to preface this post by saying no shame to people who are into this. I am also a neurodivergent individual, so the way I act and think may seem a little off.

Anyway, I am now a 22 year old senior in college and I'm kind of ready to be done. I graduated high school in 2020, so I had my first year and a half ish taken over by COVID. I went to a very large state school that was far away from home, and ended up transferring out because I was so miserable there. Everyone was going out and partying to the point that they were hungover, and this was multiple times a week. I know that this is typical college behavior, but this was also during a pandemic and I couldn't drink for health reasons. It was really hard for me to find people who have similar values and personalities, but I have found my niche at my current school. It is way more academically rigorous and I'm involved in more serious, time-consuming activities. Whenever I do get free time, which isn't often (and I actually prefer to be kept busy), I play games and just chill with some of my close friends.

This weekend is hard for me since it's Halloweekend and it seems like everyone is going out. I can't as I'm bombarded with midterms, grad school applications, tech week for a show I am in, and just the regular daily life of college. Part of me feels bad and FOMO for not going to Halloween parties. But part of me wants to prioritize these important events. I can celebrate Halloween every year, it's not every day that I have to apply to graduate school. Being off campus has made it easier to not really care what other people are doing on Friday and Saturday night, since I don't really hear or see too much. I'm also trying to limit my social media so I''m not as exposed. I went to a Halloween party last year with my friends and we all left early cause none of us liked it. Part of my disability makes small talk and meeting new people really difficult and uncomfortable. I don't like being in a crowded space with strangers who are extremely drunk. I know that lots of people like this, but this just makes me really uncomfortable and drained. 

It's much better at my current school than my old school. Obviously people are still in college and go out and party, but it's not as often and it's at a lesser extent (mostly frat parties for freshmen and upperclassmen go to apartments or cities, whenever they have time). I love to learn, do puzzles, watch tv, play games, bake, and just chill with friends. I love college and the experiences I've had, but I'm kind of ready to move on. Be with people who have similar values and mindsets. I know people will still go out and have fun, but I feel like it's different from 19 year olds who are finally away from mom and dad for the first time getting wasted. I'm ready to focus on my career and my growth, and just have the opportunity to be more of an adult. I feel really mature for my age anyways. While I love college and it's bittersweet that I'm going to be done in a few months, I'm ready for bigger and better things.

2023-10-25,1698225499,What's your experience with 12 week classes?,"I've only taken 16 week classes before. I always figured there was no way I could manage doing a class in such a condensed time. And I always assumed that spring/summer classes were just online since I started college during COVID (I never really thought about it, made sense that accelerated classes would only be online in my head), but my current school actually offers classes in person, which I definitely prefer.

With certain circumstances this year, I might have to do an accelerated class regardless, and honestly, now I'm thinking it might be a good idea in general? I figure, I need to pass at least 30 credits a year to keep my financial aid. With just Fall/Winter, that's at least 4, maybe 5 classes, which most people seem to be able to do, but it's been a lot to manage for me, especially when trying to keep a job too. And just having one less class sounds like it would be so much less stress and work. So if I did 12 credits in Fall/Winter and maybe 6 in the Spring/Summer, that already sounds a lot more manageable. Even if those 6 credits are accelerated a bit, it's only two classes. It would probably be the same amount of work as 3 classes.

And to be honest, I never really liked summer break. It's fun for the first few weeks where I have tons of freedom to do whatever I want, and then I end up wishing I just had something to do, ruining my sleep schedule for weeks on end...

Some pros: 

- They are one of two schools in Texas that actually offer a cognitive science program, which give me an opportunity to touch the computational aspects of neuroscience without getting a second degree. 

- They have a strong research opportunities and endowments. Research is key for me and career goals!! 

- Dallas has many occupational opportunities

- The MS would allow me to have access to UT Southwestern medical center (ranks high in medical school) 

- I was worried about how I would get my masters and especially applying and this kind of alleviates the stress I have. 

- Having a BS and MS would give me a strong foundation when applying to PhD programs

- I am aware that UT Dallas is considered a depressing school and has little connection between the student body. However, I care less about this as my first priority is getting my degree and excelling academically. Ill actively find ways to make my experience enjoyable. 

- Ranking is relatively low compared to UT Austin and A&amp;M university (however, Id rather get my degree now rather than later)

2023-10-19,1697729501,Dorm life as an exchange student,"Hi everybody, I (23m) am coming to the US for a semester as an exchange student from the Netherlands this spring. I am currently in the phase that I have to give my preference of housing on campus during my time there.

I can give a preference between different residence halls, on campus apartments or a specific 21+ hall which houses mostly graduate students I think.

I want to make the most of my time in the US and experience the college life but sharing a room with someone is not something Ive ever done and isnt a thing in my home country, here everyone has their own bedroom. I also definitely am a social person but I also really appreciate a moment alone to unwind. My question is if you would recommend to opt for a single room or not.

Also there is a residence hall with mostly international students but I would really like to make some American friends and Im afraid that will be harder if I am in a dorm surrounded with other internationals. On the other hand I have no idea if it will be harder to make friends in a regular residence hall since Im only staying for one semester and I have no idea how opening American students are to foreigners (I should mention I speak English fluently without an accent and Im a blond white guy, so I probably wont look out of place).

The assignments are  just a weekly, open note ""quiz"" and a 3 paragraph ""essay"" that doesn't even need any research or citations.

It's kinda complicated. I was a freshman last year. Had some medical stuff pop up 2 months in last year. Had to withdraw and go home. Now I'm back. I have a few friends here. Studied earlier woth one of those friends. Maybe mentally drained from that. I'm shy. Like social anxiety level, but I've gotten much better. I'm not someone that needs to go out a bunch...and with my medical stuff I like keeping it low key. But for some reason I just feel...meh.  

I've been in my dorm for 1.5 months. I haven't spoken to my roommates like once, they haven't spoken to me either. Except 2 time in the elevator at the very beginning. Asked if I liked my room. I said yes, then said nothing else. I feel bad. I should've said more. But my brain blanked and I just stood there waiting for the elevator to get to the floor. Not sure if that roommate doesn't like me now. I know the whole advice of people don't actually care about what you do as much as you think but yeah, feels weird when we cross paths. 

New place is opening in town. I emailed and asked if they were hiring. They asked for my availability. Sent my availability. Maybe that happens. But I'm not even sure I could do an interview without looking like an idiot. This would be my first job, I'm not a people person. But I need a job, so maybe I can just fake it. I don't know. 

Got a note under the door to our suite from some people upstairs about being loud. Which we weren't, we were sleeping. One of my roommates taped it to the door. I was going to put a note that said no clue what the upstairs people were on about. Never did that. Now I'm wondering if my roommate thinks I was being loud. Not sure why it matters. It really shouldn't. They probably don't give a shit either. 

I want to talk to my roommates. Sort of. Just think it's weird we haven't talked. Don't know what to say now that it's been 2 months. Kinda awkward. Everytime were in the common area I think maybe this time. I dont. Its like words just don't come out, like they can't. 

Might even had a breakdown in the shower after everyone went to sleep at 12:30 AM. The water was being loud, and it was annoying. Probably cause I didn't want to be too loud and keep my roommates up.

I reckon this all boils down to me caring what people think, overanalyzing and them not actually giving a shit. But this is the first time I've felt so bad...or weird. Or whatever.

Well, that's the end. Just wanted to type this out. It was all over the place. I know. Just putting some thoughts out to some random strangers on the internet.  I'm tired.

Hi! Im a Senior (18f) in Highschool and Ive been really interested in flying as a job/professionally. My school has an Aviation class that Ive taken and Ive absolutely loved it, I would love to fly as a job and have been interested in being a Pilot for quite a few years.

So far people have been telling me a lot of different things so im kind of wondering if anyone knows going to a school for Aviation is worth it? Or even trying to become a Commercial Pilot in the first place? 


After hearing from so many different people it sounds a lot like aviation school is both risky (you could fail your medical/get in lots of debt/not be hired) and expensive. Ive been recommended schools that Im told are the best only to be told by someone else to avoid it at all costs. First I heard Aviation Colleges arent worth it, then Aviation programs, and then even going into it in the first place (unless youre rich). Its freaking me out a little since my main plan has been to go into Aviation and at the beginning everyone told me it was great, now Im not so sure.

For reference, I am enrolled in a Canadian university with five courses with OSAP funding (minus living expenses due to also being on ODSP).

Now, my university recommends each student have about 36 hours available each week to do any class sessions, assignments, readings, etc.

However, in my situation, I need to work about 30-40 hours per week to afford living expenses (rent, bills, etc.) and food. While keeping the industry broad (media/broadcasting), my work can sometimes consume up to 50 hours in a week, depending on what I need to do in said week. I also do Uber Eats about two days a week for a few hours so I can afford gas and more food.

I am severely struggling to keep up with the pace because I am physically tired and mentally drained every day. In turn, I am constantly stressed out to the point where I can't focus on anything school-related; I am always thinking about my partner, being able to pay bills, having to think about what my next job is, etc.

It's to the point where it's hard to even remember the end-goal: get a degree so I can get a job where I don't need to work for five-ten different groups just to make enough money to break even on the month.

However, to get a better job, you need a degree. To get the degree, you need to quit enough jobs to free up time to do it. To pay for said degree, you need to work to be able to afford food/rent/etc. To be able to afford to take the degree, you need to work.

I thought economics would be a good choice because their are so many different industries/job opportunities i can go into in case my original plan doesnt end up working out the way I want it to, which i thought was great for someone like me whos indecisive and changes my mind a lot. I also didnt mind math too much.

However, i have no interest in most of my classes. They just feel so dull and lifeless.

I felt this way in first year too, but I was having a lot of trouble adjusting to university in general, and since I have ADHD, i basically procrastinate everything. So, i just figured that once I managed to get the hang of things more, Id start enjoying my classes. That still hasnt happened though. I still cant manage my time/classes. I have so much difficulty studying for anything because I just dont understand the math involved, nor do I want to learn any of it. Im sure part of it is because I havent been able to manage my time and get my shit together, but maybe part of it is also the fact that this degree isnt meant for me? I honestly dont know. I was thinking that maybe I could switch to Political Science  since I took a class last semester and actually really enjoyed it, but the job prospects in that field are basically obsolete. Also, the degree kind of makes me feel morally corrupt, although this may be because a lot of the students in my classes are finance/business bros lol.

I just have no clue whether or not I should switch to Poli Sci or just stick it out and continue with Econ and hope that I get a job in the industry Im interested in. I like that Econ has a lot of job opportunities, because I obviously dont want to be broke in the future, but I dont know.

It's direct admit, but my credits didn't transfer over from my school so I didn't meet the requirements. I'm trying to internally transfer, and one of my requirements is Intro To Life Processes, like a general bio but more human specific.

Now my main issue is that I just don't grasp material for some reason. I read the slides, I take notes, I haven't missed a class, I make flashcards, and I study every day. I always feel like I have everything figured out until I get to exam day and then the questions just look nothing like what I prepared for. When this happened on the first test, I assumed I just wasn't working hard enough. My second test was today, and I genuinely feel like I tried my best but I still didn't understand a lot of material on it. 

My professor doesn't really give us assignments, we just get a quiz once a month and that all we have aside from his slides. I've tried other things like quizlets, quizzes, our textbooks, and test banks, but they all seem different than what we actually get tested on. I tried emailing him and going to office hours, but he essentially says that it's not his responsibility to teach us outside of class and he gives us all of the resources we need for tests. (Just to be clear, I'm not trying to accuse him of being a bad professor or being the reason I'm failing. I respect him, he seems pretty cool, and I'm sure that there's just something I'm not grasping. I'm just trying to clear up any office hours suggestions)

I'm pretty sure I failed my midterm and I'm not sure how to change my study habits, I know I still have a chance to get my grade up for finals, and I just need a C to transfer since I have A's and B's in my other classes.

Hi everybody, I am a junior at my local college. Last year I had an amazing math professor that made me really understand the subject, and k had a good roundabout understanding of math prior. I decided to major in math. Bad choice.

I have to take two series of physics courses that I hate, and the calculus class and the lab that go with it are difficult, both of the professors are absolutely awful.

Only class I like is my computer science course and I discovered I have a knack for it and I could see myself going into the field in the future. 

I study CS so much when Im home that I dont do my school work.  Math bores me now, physics too and I feel like Im not learning in either of the courses. 

I want to do online certificates for cybersecurity and coding (Im already doing free code camp now). I just feel like Im not learning in college. I brought this up to my mother and she said I shouldnt drop college because my father invested around 12k into it and I should start what I finish. But I dont want to keep learning stuff that Im not interested in anymore. Hard to stay motivated and Im behind in my classes except for computer science. I dont want to let my mother down but I feel like I can really start learning a lot more CS on my own via online certificates. I want to prove her wrong.

I dont want to major in CS in my college because I would have to take a ton of math courses, more math courses than CS. 

What would you guys advice me? Take a semester off and pursue my coding as much as I could during that time? Build projects and get skill and learn about the industry? Or continue with the math even though Im failing my courses and dont like them?

I was a really good student in highschool, 3.7 GPA, all honors and AP and I'm currently majoring in engineering and I've always loved math/Stem fields.

I've been trying to buckle down, study more and such but I just am panicking about failing the class. 

I think the reason I think I'm struggling so bad is because in highschool I was done with my math classes after first semester of junior year so I haven't had a math class for 2 years and now I'm thrown into college math and have expected experience (which realistically I had at one point.)

I'm particularly embarrassed because I love the field and consider myself good at it but I'm struggling with one of the easier math class the uni provides. I'm not really struggling with my other classes, maybe not doing as perfect as I want but still doing good. However, the one class I want/need for my major is the one I'm struggling with.

I've been in weekly therapy, on medications, and doing everything I'm supposed to do to deal with the trauma. My class attendance is about 50/50 at this point, and I've had a couple of late assignments, but my work is quality and my grades are stable.

I know that I can finish the semester with good grades if my professors would be okay with absences and late assignments. (My work is A-worthy, I'm learning a lot, and I'm generally enjoying both of my classes.) But how likely is that?

The feedback I get from both of my professors is that they love having me in their classes, that I have great potential, and I'm smart.

I have 6 courses (they are all mandatory). The semester has 13 weeks. Together, I have no less than 5 hours of lectures (not including tutorials) every single day. With tutorials, this can add up to 7. To add to that, we are given extremely complex and large group projects in languages we don't know, in frameworks we're not taught, and every week, there is at least 1 project to submit, usually two. These projects include not just code, but multipage (10+) documentation in LaTeX, and usually a presentation. These projects take  A LONG time to finish, they are just that hard. To add to that, we have very difficult tests almost every week since the foiurth week, there's usually at least two. I am not kidding, these tests are 1.5 hours to 3 hours long from topics such as Theoretical Informatics, Advanced Statistics, Parallel Programming and Distributed Systems, etc.

There were 250 of us at the beginning of the semester (7 weeks ago). 56 people have already dropped out due to the insane workload. There is no free time, we all work CONSTANTLY. Anyone with worse than perfect time management just doesn't make it.

2023-11-02,1698951960,Dropped out of 4 different colleges - is there no hope left for me?,"So here is the timeline of my educational disaster:

2016: I graduated high-school after having a terrible time mentally/socially. I only applied for one local school but due to burn out/lack of motivation/lack of discipline I dropped out but I never formally left the school which resulted in Fs across the board for my first semester. The school was local as well and my home life at the time was not good. To be honest I was pressured by my parents to go to college but I just was not ready at the time.

2017: I had been working retail consistently while not going to school - but issues with my mother reached a boiling point and my dad decided it would be a good idea for me to go away to college to get some space. I ended up thriving there for a semester and got good grades and I was hopeful. The space away from my mom really helped. However upon starting my second semester my dad was diagnosed with brain cancer. This destroyed me because my father was my best friend and we did everything together. Without a second thought I came back to my home to help with his illness.

2018: I was home and my dad kept getting worse - Im not going to get into how intense brain cancer is - but lets just say when they initially operated on his tumor - I lost my father on the operating table. He stayed on hospice care in our home and I wanted to make him happy. All he wanted was for me to go to college it was his dream. I decided to apply for a local community college. I wish I never made this choice because my mental state was not good. I barely attended class due to my dad being in and out of the hospital and ultimately being on hospice care. Once again this resulted in F grades due to lack of attendance.

2019: At this point my father had passed away. My whole family had to move and I was so lost. I wanted to make my dad up in heaven proud and I actually got a scholarship to a music program at a great college despite my bad grades. I thought this was my chance to finally complete school but then I found out the pandemic hit. All my music courses would be online. I tried to make it work but my home life with my mother made it impossible to focus. At this time I decided to completely give up on school.

Fast forward to today: I feel at this point Ive healed from all the dramatics and Im living on my own. Ive been working jobs but without a degree its hard. My dream is to become a nurse so I can help people like my dad when he was sick - but due to my bad grades the local community college says Im not likely to get in.

Im in my 4th year but will be doing a 5th. Up until now, I have NEVER prioritized sleep and have always been in survival mode and in the hustle culture. I often pulled all-nighters for assignments (at least 1-2 times a week and 3-5 week for midterm/exam season). Even when I did sleep it would be 3-5 hrs each week (outside form weekends usually). I did this for 4 YEARS.

Some aspects would be because I did procrastinate, but others are also just because I didnt have time. Im doing 2 science majors, my job, 2 research project, 2 volunteering, trying to meet with friends. I know this isnt an excuse and I do admit I suck at balance, but I feel like doing doing less work will help and I will be doing less from now on to make more time (I quit my volunteering opportunities for now)

I had a reality check when I did horrible in my course and got sick in my life which made me realize how much I wasted my school years and how much time I wasted into education, instead of living. 

I am changing from today and will be doing better (got my goals and plans and have dropped my course load), but Ive been INCREDIBLY anxious the past week thinking about truthfully how Ive shortened my lifespan because of my all-nighters and Im going to die soon. Legit its been the only thing on my mind for the past week and Ive been really pessimestic. 

Im just thinking if any one had any similar experience with all nighters or maybe did what I did and survived through it? Idk Im really anxious typing this.",college,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17ht6v6/ive_been_pulling_too_many_allnighters_in_my/

2023-10-19,1697702327,Barely slept all semester because of suitemates,"Hi everyone, putting this out into the void hoping someone will give me meaningful advice on how to handle this situation.

To establish context, Im an RA in a suite style residence hall for upperclassmen. I have a single in a suite where theres also two sophomores in another room. These guys are complete shut ins. They are awake from 10 pm to 7 am gaming and yelling, go to sleep, then wake up at noon to go to their one class per day and then come back at 10 pm screaming and slamming doors. Theyre international students from China, so I get wanting to be on a schedule where you can talk to friends from back home. But this is ridiculous, and its clear they have no intention of compromising. I have attempted to ask them multiple times a week this semester (were in like week 9 now) and I either get no response (they seriously pretend like theyre not in the room while I stand outside knocking or just ignore me) or an okay, we will and it never lasts more than 20 minutes. I average about 4 hours of sleep a night because of this. This doesnt even begin to touch the fact they dont throw out their trash and leave it in the common area (mostly in front of my door).

We just signed our roommate agreements like last week which is absurd, but when I was facilitating the discussion I brought up when we all went to sleep. They said midnight (an obvious lie) and so I proceeded to ask how we want to handle ourselves after this time, and they said well whisper. I thought that was great! Theyre conscious theres an issue and willing to concede some things. Apparently not. Every night this week Ive had to continue knocking well into 4 am to attempt to quiet down, and every time I try to confront them during the day they wont open the door or say theyre busy. 

Tonight was my last straw. I have an 8 am tomorrow, and I knocked around 2 am. They ignored me as usual, but after about 5 minutes they paused heir game, slammed their door intentionally, and started yelling way louder than usual. Its about 4 am now and they still havent quieted down. They also said they would throw out their own trash during our roommate agreement session, but theres about 4 dominos pizza boxes in front of my door that have been there since Sunday and theyre not mine, among plenty of cans and water bottles.

I intend to bring this up to my superior tomorrow, but given my position I feel very messed up. I feel like I dont have control of my own living space much less relationships with these residents. We have our second round of mid semester check ins with our residents this week, but I cant conduct it with them given the current relationship. I cant cite them for being loud, nor am I sure thats a reasonable course of action. I cant be in my room when I need to sleep but I cant change my room. I dont think theyll ever want to move nor will they be responsive to any form of mediation; Ive tried and been ghosted so many times, plus I feel weird given Im supposed to be the mediator and cant seem to handle this. Im out of energy and its severely affecting my physical, mental, and social health, and academic health. 

If youve read my sad story so far thanks. I dont know what type of advice I expect, but its been nice talking to the void.

I am taking a class that is well known at my school for being a tough class. It is a law class that focuses on courtroom communication. Last week, for our midterm, each student had to complete a type up document where we summarized the facts of a presented legal case. I did relatively well on that [91/100]. 

After that, our professor required that we answer 4 additional questions, 300-500 words a piece, totaling 1,2002,000 words total. Far more than 'part 1' of the midterm. The tricky part is, in the assignment descriptions, the professor only included a vague statement and an equally vague question for us to answer. I sent multiple emails about requirements and got back equally vague answers. After multiple questions and little direction, I did my best. 

Today, I got back my scores and... they're really low. I have never done ""this bad"" in this class, and I am super bummed. I know that I am a competent writer ( I have worked really hard on the skill for 10+ years and have taken various courses to improve, etc). 

I want to ask my professor about my grades and if I can redo it, but I'm unsure how to. Does anyone have any tips or suggestions on how to approach this?


**EDIT/UPDATE**

Thank you, everyone who responded. I reached out to the professor (using an example in the comments below. I highly appreciate the example). The professor expressed that everyone in the class did poorly on this aspect of the test. He is allowing everyone to redo the questions and made sure to include a rubric for guidance. He admitted that he intended for the questions to be vague, but upon review, he realized they were phrased poorly.

I was preparing myself to feel that, but for some reason it just never came. I don't miss home at all. I feel a lil guilty when I say that.

Maybe it's because home for me is only like two to three hours away, but I feel like it's not completely because of that since I literally just don't think about home at all. I haven't had the thought of ""oh I can always go back home when I want"" once. Maybe it's because I came from a bit of toxic competitive high school where I felt dumb all the time, and I'm meeting so many people who are actually normal and just as lost as I am. Maybe it's because I was constantly butting heads with my parents and I needed some space for myself. My household wasn't super toxic, but Asian parents lol

I miss my friends. I miss eating good Asian food all the time. I miss my family, I guess. I kind of miss knowing everyone around me and feeling close to my class, but I also kind of love the freedom that comes with not knowing everyone. That's kind of it though. I guess when I think about home, I remember that all my friends are also going through the same things and we're all trying to make the next steps of our lives, and being back home just feels like I'm going back on that progress.

And I know I'm fortunate to not feel homesick because a lot of people are struggling with that, my friend already flew back home because she couldn't take it anymore lol. Maybe it'll hit me in another month. But yeah, anyone not feel homesick at all?",college,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/178tnwf/does_anyone_else_not_feel_homesick_at_all/

Im in my 4th year of college and have changed my major 3 times and failed the last 4 semesters. Obviously the paths i set out on have not been working for me but no one at my community college is helping me. Even in high school no one would help me find my way i guess. No matter how many counselors i speak to no one will help me so im turning to reddit in desperation i guess. 

I started out as a general studies major but changed to an anthropology major which was not for me. I then switched to Computer Gaming and Simulation as my major. Every semester in my last two majors i have failed every class i have had. So clearly i need a different path but i dont know where to go. 

I love games (especially horror games) but that path didnt work out. 

I love special effects makeup and am pretty good at it (at least thats what im told i think im mediocre) but i dont even know how to do that as a profession. 

I love listening to true crime podcasts and recently ive been watching videos on the breakdown on criminal interrogations on youtube but where can that take me? My grandfather and father were morticians but I really dont think i could handle seeing a read dead body especially if it is a mruder victim and ESPECIALLY if that victim was a child or mentally handicapped. Same if i went down the path of criminal investigator, if the person im interrogating is a mruder of a child or me tally handicapped person i dont think i could be calm in their presence. 

I literally have no other hobbies or interests. Literally none. 

I used to want to be a special needs teacher, but then a special needs student at my school passed and it put into perspective how i could lose a child in that profession and it would hurt to much to deal with. Same with medical fields. 

I have never in my life had passions. I simply liked what i liked. I have never had a i was born to do this or this is my dream in my life. I didnt do well in school. I was more artsy but i never was passionate about any of the arts. I did to theatre (stage crew) for 7 years but that was to get student service hours. I didnt hate it but i didnt like it. And every extra curricular i did turned out to not be for me. Film studies? To technical and boring. Chorus? My voice is not at all good. Nutrition and fitness? Traumatizing (heavy-set girl in a class about health. Bullying central) child development? The classroom i interned in was to chaotic and i was having panic attacks. Government? Fck everything about gov. 

I literally dont know what to do with my life while every one of my friends is graduating and finding internships and jobs and starting their lives and im stuck. And im not comparing myself to them cause everyone goes at their own pace in life but i feel like im stagnant in life and just going through the motions making no progress. I feel so helpless and lost. I was diagnosed with depression but i feel that has nothing to do with it.

Without going too deep into it, I do really well on normal assignments but due to testing anxiety I bombed two exams (less than 50% on both).

I decided to start studying more and making my own practice tests along with the homework to lessen my anxiety. I got a 90% on the recent exam and because it was only ten questions (compared to the normal 20-25) I was able to finish it much quicker than the other ones (an hour compared to the nearly 3 hours that it usually takes me). 

I was super excited until I started wondering if the drastic change would make the professor assume I was cheating. Its an online course but we are recorded through lockdown browser (Im autistic and look around/fidget when Im thinking which I heard is flagged as suspicious behavior) and we have to submit our work afterwards (I showed all my work but am worried that is not enough or I may have accidentally forgotten to write down a step I did in my head).

But even though I lost interest in the arts I didnt gain a love of anything else. I still didnt want to BE anything else. Plus I began to experience serious depression in high school so all of that led to me losing a love of all my original interests.

(I also put this in r/advice and r/teenagers LOL I genuinely dont know what to do)

(this also happened yesterday, but its still on my mind)

I (18F) am the eldest daughter to two immigrants, living in California (so this is why Im asking for advice LOL) and I go to community college. 

For context, I just got hired to work at a daycare, and upon hire, they ask that you go get a basic physical checkup and provide results. The clinic I was assigned to go to has a very limited number of physicals they take on the daily, so I have to get up really early tomorrow if I want to make it before my deadline.

The issue is, Im in charge of taking care of my little sister (9F) and have to take her to school every morning. That includes getting her ready, feeding her breakfast, and driving her to school. But I fell behind and am only able to get up early enough to drive her to school. My father does the first half. Honestly, this is on me because I spend a lot of time during the night talking to my friends online instead of getting sleep to wake up early. 

So my mom and I planned what were going to do tomorrow: I take my little sister with me to the clinic and feed her breakfast, then just drop her off late.

When we told my father our plans at dinner, he got VERY angry.

When I left the house to go to rehearsal for the show Im in (I also do theatre), my mom called me and told me about how she and my dad had an argument about it and he started talking about how HES never included in my mom and Is plans, how HE always gets up early to feed and clothe my sister and how IM not doing my share of work.

This isnt new to me. When my fathers angry he will say the most insulting things ever, especially when its about me.

Im just so confused. When he asks me to focus on my studies, I do. He says do whatever you want, as long as you have an A. But it absolutely does not feel like that at all.

After two years of community college, I initially planned to transfer to San Francisco State University. But I absolutely cannot take this anymore.

This is the part where I need advice. My dad is very careful about finances, and hes always made saving money a big point for me ever since I was young. I want to transfer to SFSU as soon as possible. But if I move out now, I just know Ill feel such a big guilt and selfishness over leaving my family. Or feel as if Im leaving a financial dent because of tuition fees. My father doesnt say this, but my mother does all the time. They need me. Especially for my sister, whom I am also very close with. And when Im not there, what happens?

What do I do? Should I move out for my sake? Or do I stay longer for them?

TL;DR: I am the eldest daughter of immigrants and my father makes me feel worthless. But if I move out Ill feel guilty because of finances and because of my sister.

Now, I'm reading everything I can on the balance of working full time and taking classes. I'm doing it all online. I'd like to not take 7-8 years to get a bachelor's degree, but I also know that taking four classes at a time on top of working full time might be a reach. 

My CC does have the accelerated 7 week classes for many of the courses. I fully get that it's the same amount of work in half the time. What I don't have a grasp on yet, is how much time/work is required for a class. I'd love to take two 7 week classes at a time to keep pace credit-wise, but am I going to drive myself insane doing so? I'm very good with time management, but is there enough actual time to manage?


TL;DR- I stopped making excuses and I'm starting school in my mid 30s. I need more information so I can make a solid plan.

I was so miserable and lonely, and I was also simultaneously working 30ish hours a week at my highschool job. This job (which I still work at) brought me a sense of comfort, and for this reason I think staying home for college was 100% lonely. I wanted to transfer so badly, but I ended up withdrawing all of my classes because I would have not passed a single class. Something must have happened in my brain over winter break, because I enrolled again at my community college and ended with a 3.6 gpa&I was the most motivated and academically successful I had been in a long time. I got into a few schools, and for the start of my sophomore year I am at a big SEC school. Its middle of the first semester, about 11 weeks in and I am so incredibly depressed.

I have 2 friends who are not really my friends, while everyone around me has big friend groups. All my friends from home never had a problem making friends, but for me, I have had a really bad experience. I have joined a sorority and 3 business clubs. I have done what I can do to make friends and Ive had no luck. I have never found myself so insecure-I hate the way I look, act, everything. I feel like Im extremely weird because of my lack of friendships Ive made. In high school I had so many friends, and I could make friends with anyone. What is wrong with me? And weirdly enough, my academics are the only reason I am still going. I spent about 25 hours a week in the library, and I have around a 3.8 gpa. Is this what I am meant for?

I wanted to share my academic journey as a third year student and the persistent challenge I've been facing. No matter how hard I study, it seems like I always end up with average or lower grades.

At the every beginning of my college year, I'm highly motivated and dedicated. I put in much effort, but after a few disappointing grades, I find myself losing that motivation. This year, I thought I'd cracked the code by discovering my learning style: kinesthetic learning. I applied this during lectures and while studying at home, and everything seemed to be going great. I was grasping the material easily. 

But yet again, when it came to exams and assignments, I found myself in the same position - receiving poor grades. I'm at a loss now and not sure what to do next.

* 2018 - 2019: Bachelor's English teaching. Did this for 1,5 years before deciding teaching ultimately wasn't for me.
* 2020: Bachelor's Pedagogy. Did this for a couple months because I had no idea what else to do. Got absolutely fed up with it after a few months.
* 2021 - 2023: Bachelor's Animal Management. Absolutely loved this, but had to drop out due to long-term illness in my second year.
* 2023 - now: Associate's Animal Management. Basically the two-year version of the bachelor's, but the level is much lower.

As you can gather, the bachelor's Animal Management was something I really loved doing. When I had to drop out, I chose to settle for the associate's version. That's something I really, really regret. This program is way too easy and doesn't really offer anything substantial compared to the bachelor's. I'm having quite a hard time adjusting to the much lower level and I'm thinking of switching back to a bachelor's again, likely Applied Biology. I then hope to be able to graduate some time at age 27 or 28.

Could anyone possibly relate to my situation? I don't think I've ever met someone who's switched courses as much as I have.

Right now, I'm going into my second semester of sophomore year. I'm an accounting major right now. I initially chose accounting because that was the practical choice for me - my father's a CPA, so I have the connections I need, and it has pretty good job security and good pay. I'm pretty smart, as I've consistently gotten good grades throughout high school and even got admitted to an honors program when I applied to the school I'm currently in. I immediately got admitted to the accelerated 5-year master's program for a MAcc as well.

However, I've been reflecting, and I genuinely hate accounting. I hate it. I can't see myself doing it for the rest of my life. It's even evident in my grades, as I haven't been able to manage above a C+ for any accounting class yet. It's not my passion *(I've been gaslighting myself, saying, 'Who* ***really*** *likes* ***accounting****, anyways?' for the last year and a half)*, I don't do well; I'm struggling to understand everything, which causes more stress than anything else in my life. I've spoken to my parents, as they do pay for my college education, and although my mother is somewhat supportive, my father is angry with me for wanting to switch my major. If I choose something practical, he'll still pay for at least some of my education, but I know he will pull out financially at least a little, which I'm prepared for.

My biggest issue now is that I'm stuck on what I really want to do. I don't have any likes/dislikes/hobbies that would fit into a major (I love to crochet, watch TV, etc). I'm a people person for sure, and I want to have a job where I'm not just sitting at a desk all day, staring at numbers and creating balance sheets and income statements. I'm nervous to look at anything outside of business, as then most of my core classes I've taken already wouldn't count. But I don't feel like anything in the business school is for me.

I also have my slightly easier courses this term. I'm honestly not sure when I'll ever get a semester like this again. 

But despite all of this i'm finding that I'm taking things WAY too lightly now and not rlly taking advantage of the free time the way I should be. I keep putting off things to the VERY last minute, I get this is a common issue amongst many students, but I've been doing it way more often. I've even turned in two assignments late (with a penalty ofc).

Long story short, I have an online class that the instructor thought it would be a great idea to have a debate at the end of the year. Not my first time with the instructor, but last semester she was a lot more diligent in reminding us about the steps of the debate and whatnot. Something I need because I'm the type of person who forgets whether or not I took my medication. The instructions were posted at the beginning of the semester, I gave them a brief once over and then never looked again (mainly because I forgot they existed), and today the outline of the debate was due, which is the first time we had to turn in an outline. 

I didn't know about it until today when I looked in the weekly folder to see what was due, because she still has the due date being sometime in the summer, so it didn't pop up as ""due soon."" So, when I turned it in, it of course says ""Late."" No big deal, I can't control that. 

However, while I was working on the outline, I was rereading the instructions for the debate and saw a small section where it stated we were to inform her of our stance at the end of the second unit, four weeks ago. I had skipped over it the first time, and nowhere in the second unit did it state we were to inform her of our stance. She didn't even send out an email as a reminder as she had during last semester. I don't know if any of my classmates emailed her either. She didn't make any sort of note on any of the coursework I've turned in since then to remind me either. As far as I know, the email isn't graded, it was just for her to gain an understanding on our positioning on the debate. Regardless, I can't do anything about it now.

As I mentioned, I did the outline and turned it in. Not my best work, I forgot to include a conclusion like an idiot, but I did utilize my sources and whatnot. I use outlines as a general guide anyways, I don't typically state my intro, body, and conclusion on them word for word. SafeAssign of course flagged all of the sources on my References page as ""plagiarized,"" so my assignment report is sitting at a ""High Risk"". However, I know that those reports are bogus. The only thing I can do is sit and wait for her to grade it and accept whatever it is.

Regardless, I wish I could just rewind a week and actually put some effort into this assignment. I just feel like an idiot. Procrastinating isn't fun in the long run. I used to not be as much of a procrastinator, I don't know what happened, but now it's something so constant that it might as well be chronic.

I have only been here for a few months but it seems like everybody around me has found their clicks besides me. There are no parties, barely any clubs, and while I get along with both of my roommates one of my roommates is a different major and has her own friends, she is also always busy and the other one goes to bed early and doesn't really like to go out. So I guess what I am looking for is advice. Does it get better? Should I start looking at new schools or try to hold out the rest of the year? How do I get more social? Any advice will work.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17k7bww/i_dont_know_if_i_like_my_small_school/

I thought Id be so excited by this point and even more motivated to finish the semester strong while graduation is looming. Its the total opposite.

Im so sick of it. Id rather do just about anything else with my time than assignments and lectures. I have wonderful grades and have always tried to pay attention and truly learn from the material. Now my brain just blanks. At the end of class I feel like I was tuned out mentally the entire time and I cant retain anything anymore. Almost feels like my professors are no longer speaking English. I used to love to read and I used to be good at math - now I rarely open a book because when I do, I have to reread the paragraph 10x to absorb it. And now assignments that involve math just make me feel jumbled and even a basic problem just gives me a headache.

How do you get through the brain fog and burnout? Both academically and mental health wise? Im so worried Ill flunk my finals for the first time ever, soley because my brain seems to have just decided it is done and refuses to take in more information.

2023-10-29,1698548256,Im Never Invited,"Im a sophomore in a community college. I live at home because Im able to easily commute to my classes. Ive maintained a 3.5-3.6 GPA for the past year, and I even joined the womens lacrosse team this year. I feel extremely proud of myself. But Im not necessarily happy.

My friends, who still live in our hometown, (one goes to the same college as I do, the other goes to a different college nearby) have never invited me to go out with them. Ive expressed to the both of them several times that Id like to get out and do more. They tend to say something along the lines of Oh yeah, we can definitely go out sometime soon!, or Yeah, just let me know when&. But surprise surprise, it never happens. Im not the type of person to just invite myself to places, Id rather wait until I receive an invite. But they never reach out to formally invite me. This is a nightmare for me because I have pretty bad anxiety, so I tend to start bashing myself, or I think they secretly dont like me. Another friend told me that she thinks they really dont like me though, which honestly made me feel worse about this situation. Its just a huge bummer because when I entered college, I expected to be going out at least once a week. I havent gone out a single time. The only time I get to party is when a completely different set of friends, who are currently away for college, come home for the winter or summer breaks. I literally feel like a loser. I feel like my entire life is all about class, my job, my internship, and sports practices. Im sad because I feel like I never get to have fun. I dont think Ill get to go to a single party this year. I also feel like I have no real friends. The only person I have is my boyfriend, and hes an hour and a half away for college. I only get to see him twice a month ish because of our schedules (he is also a lacrosse player). The only hope I have of making friends this year is my lacrosse team. Although, since I just started, I havent gotten to know my teammates too well yet. Im hoping at least one of them wants to go out with me at some point.

Basically, I feel like a loser and a loner. I dont know where to go from here. I need some suggestions on how to deal with this major FOMO.

As the title says, Im looking to graduate with a double major in computer science and physics. I wanted to ask to see if this could be beneficial for me career wise and if it is logical/feasible.

Currently, I am enrolled at a community college to take care of core credits. I dont have a lot of money so I am trying to cut down as much as I can, especially using programs like CLEP. I am looking to pursue this because I have always had a deep love for both of these subjects. Computer Science because I have always loved pretty much anything relating to this subject and love tech and programming, and physics because I have always loved learning how the world works as well as the models and interpretations that come with it and what you can do with that knowledge.

I have considered switching physics for math multiple times because I have been told a math degree could better supplement, but I wanted to get further information before diving headfirst into my plan.

Thank you for your time.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17cj5mk/double_major_physics_comp_sci_is_it_worth_it/
2023-10-20,1697765946,I feel like a failure for still not being graduated.,"TW: mentions of ED

So, I'm 23 and I *still* haven't been able to graduate. I ended up taking two gap years due to Covid and extreme mental and physical health decline. I *hate* college with every fiber of my being.

While I was living on campus, the geniuses at my school built a food hall that failed fire code twice. How do you manage to fail more than once? Because of that the food quality when down I got incredibly sick. Like, eat a meal and then run to the bathroom to get sick 20 minutes later kind of sick. I ended up losing 15 pounds in 3 months. I wasn't the kind of person that had 15 pounds to lose, either. I got placed on the extremely underweight portion of the BMI, and only then did my university take notice.

This had lasting impacts on my stomach and my ability to eat food. I wouldn't eat unless I had to, and even then it was limiting in what I could eat - apples, bananas, spinach, maybe some meat here and there. My stomach would rebel and it was terrible. It took me a long time to get back to be able to see food as friendly and not dangerous.

Then once Covid hit, I dropped out. I was sick physically and then the mental illness kicked in. I was afraid to be alone sometimes. I've gotten a lot better, but my anxiety I was feeling made my stomach problems even worse (if that was possible). Eating would cause dry heaving sometimes, and I couldn't control it.

My family heard that I had dropped out, and that just wasn't what they wanted from me. So my grandparents made it their mission to make me want to go back. I understand why they did it, education got them out of literal poverty, so I respect their drive to want a better life for me. I was given a college fund by my great aunt, so my education is almost fully paid for. I still have to provide my own gas/groceries/insurance. I work full time in order to save for the things I want in life, my wedding and home I will have in the future. I'm also trying to set aside some extra money for retirement, but it's been difficult.

But right now my present kinda sucks. I hate my university for what they did to me. They fucked me up, could've killed me if it had spiraled into an ED (thankfully it didn't as far as I know, I have since been able to return to eating almost anything now, whoo). My best friend graduated on time last year and it's been eating at me. All my boyfriend's siblings are the same age as me and will graduate before me because they didn't have the same mental health struggles I did.

I'm stuck in school and everyone else I know isn't. They're off having fun at their careers, getting engaged, getting married and I just feel stuck having to do intro-level classes again. I won't graduate until I'm 24. Which pushes back a wedding date (I already have the boyfriend, he wants to wait to get engaged until I have degree in hand), which pushes back kids, which pushes the back the important, enjoyable, beautiful moments in life.

Because these moments don't feel that way. I feel traumatized and hungry and scared and anxious and I hate it.

I'm also going to school online, so I'm not really making any friends. Not that I made many friends when I was in person, either. So far this whole myth that college is supposed to be fun - or hell, I'd take ""tolerable"" at this point - just seems to far-fetched. All I want is to have them mail me my degree, take the postage out of the fund that pays the professors, and then send me on my merry way so I never have to step food on that campus ever again for as long as I live.

I'm pretty sure I sound entitled, but I don't care. This struggle isn't what I had envisioned. I just want to be healed, be better, be done with school and assignments and assignment anxiety so I can move onto things that matter in life, starting a family and creating a beautiful marriage.

I just want to hear from someone that I'm not crazy. That they would also be mad in my shoes. That life isn't all bad even if it feels that way. Maybe I just need to go touch some grass, idk.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17bzkl2/i_feel_like_a_failure_for_still_not_being/

so community college was supposed to be a second chance, but im (almost) halfway through my first semester and my grades are awful. the reason for this is 100% because i didnt have an available car at the start of the semester, and im taking it online. i am absolutely AWFUL at online school, i have terrible issues paying attention and sometimes i just dont even show up to the classes.

every semester after this i am 100% going in person, and im not sure how long i plan on staying in community, but at this point i feel like id probably have to stay the whole 2 years before i can apply to a 4 year.

essentially, my question is, when applying to a 4 year college, will a really bad first semester mean that much? if i can keep a solid gpa for the rest of the time how much will that matter?

I have a professor in one of my classes who I have also worked under as an RA for about a year, so I see her quite often. Shes very kind, and I like her a lot. 

For some context, I am from Maine and going to school on the other side of the country.

Its been hard to deal with, mainly because Im the only person from Maine anyone here knows and I keep getting asked about the shooting. Constantly. Its exhausting, and its REALLY not helping my mental health. 

Today at the beginning of class (theres only about ten of us students in there), my professor publicly asked how I was doing while reminding the class where I was from, and asked for details about the shooting and how I was dealing with it. I felt very put on the spot and did the whole Its been a bit difficult, but Im doing well shtick, and class proceeded as normal. Meanwhile, everyones gawking at me like Im some exotic zoo animal. The entire thing just made me ridiculously uncomfortable. 

I feel like I should bring this up with her, but my question is how should I do that? Shes both the researcher I work under and my professor, and shes an awesome person who I really admire. I dont want to potentially jeopardize anything academically or professionally. So I guess Im asking this:

She has her own fridge, I never really see her cooking so thats her own business. Me and M share a room, and the mini fridge in the kitchen is ours. M is not a bad roommate, he is not a dirty person, a little messy but not enough to get in my way at all. I used to be a messy person before I moved out - now Im a lot more organized simply because I have to be.

Im the kind of person who, after I cook, I clean right away. They are not. I frequently come home exhausted from school (we are all in college) just to have to do a pile of dishes for all of us because I know that if I dont, it wont get done, at least not before I actually need to use the kitchen for something.

I also know he has a much tougher workload than me and he is tired all the time, if anything he is also depressed. This is no excuse not to take care of our apartment but, I have empathy because I care about him so much. For F, I barely see her let alone tell her about anything cleaning related. And theres no just let it be and see how bad it gets until they clean - I clean this much because otherwise its deeply uncomfortable to exist in the only place thats mine. I care about my home, no matter how small it is, its all we have. M always offers to clean more, and is always apologizing and saying he feels bad because I clean so much. I dont really get any thank yous though. If I was actually appreciated for what I do or something maybe it would be different& I feel stuck because this is a year long lease.

The first year I tried my best to study on the train (1 hour) but failed miserably due to being easily distracted by noise and people talking throughout the ride. After the train, I get on a bus for about another hour, which is about a 50/50 chance of me getting motion sick and not being able to do anything. With this in mind, I then have to go home feeling sick and tired just to do all the work I need to do to succeed. I sacrifice my hobbies, social life, family time, mental health and sleep just to fail to get the GPA I want/need to further my studies. I just want out, I am exhausted and done.

For some context: I tend to be unable to speak when it's in front of a group or when it's just people I don't know and combined with a speech impediment makes speaking very difficult for me.

My professor loves to call on me for everything, and while my speaking issues isn't an excuse not to participate at all. There are times where I'm called on multiple times a class when some people aren't even called on once. If I make a mistake the entire class has to hear about it. 

I've skipped the last four classes, but I really want to succeed in college. I'm tired of crying before class starts every single time.

Should I tell her she's overwhelming me? I don't want her to feel bad as in all honesty she's one of my favorite professors and I can tell that it's not her intent, as she has mentioned that a family member suffers from the same thing when she brought up why she has certain people talk more than others, but sadly I feel like she is missing the mark.",college,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17gwlsr/should_i_tell_my_professor_shes_overwhelming_me/

Im 21 now but I still need my mom. It pains me that I cant share this life with her anymore. Weve always had so many visions of the future and what we wanted to do, I just have to do it myself now, for me and for her. I told her goodnight and I love you the night before she died, not knowing it would be the last time. Im glad I got one more in before I knew it would be the last.

So basically the title, we have a group project that is worth 30% in what I would consider a fairly easy class.

The group is randomly assigned and so far no one has done any work apart from myself. We have a group chat that another member of the group started that no one responds to. I've asked them a couple of times if they have done anything for our next assignment and i've had zero response.

Do I reach out as soon as possible or do I just deal with it, do all the work myself, and then tell the professor?

2023-10-25,1698274776,I feel like I may not be smart enough for college....,"I am not smart enough, or just dumb, and that I actually may fail my school, where my goals are, or rather were but still are, to achieve more \~ this incredibly frustrates, and mainly saddens me, and motivates too. I have a lot of mixed emotions, I never experienced this.  


I have no clue of an appropriate way to introduce my post, as introducing things have never been my strong side.   


I began my first college semester about a month ago, and I know that after one month such post may seem ridiculous or even childish, and I believe that so too. However, I feel like I missed my starting opportunity to catch on, to start studying in the appropriate way. I feel like that due to my first mismanagement I now won't be able to relate to anything that is being presented on the lectures - and this is based on facts, as I honestly do not understand anything that is being presented, and If I do, I do not understand it in the way where I can relate it to the topic as a whole.   
It also seems that I am the only one that does not understand, I am a bit afraid to ask questions as they may seem stupid.

I study a STEM school in Europe, my first semester consists of mainly mathematics \[ Linear Algebra, Mathematical Analysis and Logic , and others.. \]. I must have misunderstand Linear Algebra, and now I am slowly advancing but I feel like I am constantly catching up. The same is with Mathematical Analysis and Logic, or rather everything. I really love mathematics, and I did not have a problem in High School with it. I feel extremely useless as a student and that I may not be able to achieve my goals... everyone around me acts incredibly smart, they act adultly , and mainly responsibly. I do not feel that I am acting that way.  


In addition I have very little time to revise during the week after school , or learn, and I feel that if I learn, I learn slow, or too little to be of great convenience.   

I am losing myself in the world of distractions and tries of studies. 

This post is just my way of letting my stress out in a written way.   
Thanks for, even, reading my stress relief post.

2023-10-12,1697111338,"Everyone, including me, in this class is failing under a terror prof. What should I do?"," Hello everyone, I know this is a very general concern so allow me to explain my situation.

I have a professor who teaches philosophy, specifically the field of ethics. In my head, I generally disagree with her on a lot of her teachings which are very traditional (e.g., anti-contraception, anti-IVF, anti-divorce, etc.) but I never contend with her outright. She uses the book that she wrote as the class material and I do my best to study and understand her lessons. I do my best to use her teaching and terminology, but she tends to grade very low during her tests which are always essay-type.

Last week's midterms *especially* fucked me and the rest of the batch over. Everyone I know in the class is failing--either that or they're passing by just a slim margin, which will likely change after she grades all of our papers.

I am a scholar and within the terms of my contract, I am allowed to drop one subject for valid reasons (e.g., health reasons, threat to life, etc.). I am looking to talk to the admissions office in the near future to see if dropping this subject is possible; however, this is a last resort as this will immediately forfeit my chance to become a DL. And as much as possible, I don't want to retake this subject.

There has also been cases of unfair treatment between my class and the other classes. I do not know why this is the case, but here are a couple of examples: (a) I have friends in her other class (same sub, different time slot) that relay to me how their class went and tell me how she finishes the lessons promptly, while in our class she doesn't finish on time and leaves us to study the material ourselves. (b) After our midterm exam, in her other class she dictated the correct answers before letting them retake it and use the whole time (1hr30mins), while in our class she did not dictate and gave us only 1 hour to retake the exam.

I have been looking to bring up my situation/concern to the Center of Student Affairs, but I have heard that many students have tried to do that before and failed, as she is a long-standing professor in the university and apparently also holds a position in the disciplinary panel.

I could also ask for a grade consultation with the prof one of these days but frankly I don't know what to ask or how to go about this whole situation.

What should I do? Are there other options/things I can do?

Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated. Let me know if you have any questions. Thanks for taking the time to read.

Yes it was so bad I was placed in special education for many years. It wasn't until I gained passion for learning what I wanted to do. In which I became better. I am pursuing a degree in biology and may get into more so I can become an astrobiologist. 

  When I look at an IQ test I realize something it's not about how smart you are. It's about how well you can learn and how fast you can problem solve.  

  I'm mentioning IQ because I understand either you feel your dumb or you took an IQ test that says your dumb.  I think I can explain but best. 

  Imagine a genius 140 IQ he reads what he learns and advanced really quick to the next part, A guy with average intelligence will probably have to read it once or twice maybe take some notes and a 2 hour assignment takes them well 2 hours maybe 3 hours. 

  Now people like us who are mentally challenged. It's rough and that's something you are gonna have to understand. You are gonna have to watch videos on what your learning, read it, take notes, review it for a very long time and all for most of that information to flush out because we don't have a good memory capacity. Sleep and Eating? Barely because well your too busy learning materials that should take only  well no more than like 4 hours in multiple classes. It takes a average person 2x reading to learn it will take you about 10x if that makes sense. 

  I love learning I love it so much. However, it's been a complete nightmare mentally draining feeling like I'm not good enough but I keep pushing and pushing learning and learning.

2023-10-20,1697787661,"Reminder: you're doing great in college, considering the circumstances!","Hey. From one college student to another, I just wanted to say that I know college can be really tough, and you're honestly doing great considering the circumstances. With how stressful the world is right now, it makes sense that you're struggling in some areas. Overdue assignments, not enough sleep, and using doom scrolling to cope- it's all super understandable. 

I see you doing great in some aspects, too. While successes vary for everyone, you know what you've been doing well. If not, now might be a good time to reflect on what's going good and give yourself a pat on the back for that! If you can't think of anything, feel free to ask a trusted friend. If they're truly your friend, they'll help you celebrate even small wins. 

No matter how your midterms are going, you're getting through the semester, and that's worth being proud of. If you can't be proud of yourself right now, please know that I'm proud of you.

 You're doing so much better than you think, and, even if you can't see it right now, so much good is on the way. Keep going.",college,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17c5lwv/reminder_youre_doing_great_in_college_considering/
2023-10-14,1697252269,I don't know if I should graduate early,"So I'm a current second year. Technically, because I graduated high school with an associate's degree, I could graduate with my bachelor's this spring. I'm hesitant to do so for a few reasons: 

* I don't have a plan or idea of what I want to do 
* I don't have hardly any job experience and would like to get an internship/more academic-type experience 
* I thoroughly enjoy learning and don't want to give it up yet. 
* I would basically only end up taking classes in my major (which I think is okay but there would be no room to take anything else)
* I don't feel ready to join the ""real world"" as a real adult
* I feel grossly under qualified to have a bachelor's degree as soon as June

I do see the benefits to graduating early, such as cost, getting started on a career sooner, making money sooner (theoretically), and that kind of stuff. The cost of school is something I am aware of, and of course it would be better for me financially to graduate early, but it would also get figured out. If I want to stay another year and graduate in 2025, which is my plan right now, my parents are fine with it. At the same time though, my parents are mostly paying for school right now and their college savings for me won't fully cover this year and next year. My dad said we'd figure it out but I also don't want to waste their money just taking classes that don't pertain to my major. Of course, I could minor in something, but at this point there isn't one obvious subject I'd want to minor in. I could pick something to minor in, I just haven't necessarily found something that warrants me to do so.

My main concern is that I don't have a plan or an idea of what career path I want to pursue. I feel like I have narrowed it down more from what it was a year ago, and I feel like staying in school longer could potentially narrow it down even more. 

&amp;#x200B;

I just don't know what I should do: whether I should graduate this Spring or 2025. Obviously I'm really the only person that can decide that, but any advice would very much be appreciated. ",college,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/177fu01/i_dont_know_if_i_should_graduate_early/

2023-11-01,1698868101,I bombed my first semester of college. Has anyone else experienced this and how did you recover?,"(20M) As the title suggests, I absolutely bombed my first semester at a local college. I got a late start to college because I wanted to save up and experience different industries before committing to a university. After working full time for a few years I decided I should go to a local CC so I could at least knock my generals out of the way and major in something business related, (business admin, finance, or accounting, etc..)

January 2023, I started studying for the SAT to remove holds on my application, and I took the exam March 11th. I scored a 1200. Not too shabby considering my 3.3GPA in high-school. I registered for my classes as soon as I could and I was set! I was so hopeful and excited for college but in hindsight, I wasn't even remotely prepared. COVID screwed up my last two years of high-school and my attention span/studying skills left much to be desired.

On top of a struggling junior/senior year, I took 5 classes which is exorbitant for a first time student who also works 30+ hours/week. I did cut work days and a class but it didn't seem to matter much. I was so overwhelmed, in some cases for no reason at all. My assignments were turned in, I was showing up to class and yet it was like my brain short-circuited. I couldn't focus or retain a damn thing, I hardly ate or slept for the few short weeks I was in college and my anxiety was crippling. It's completely pathetic, I'm literally a grown ass man who couldn't handle some gen ed classes. 

I dropped all of my classes on census day, closed my computer and cried myself to sleep. The silver lining is my transcripts are fine, no F's or W's. The bad news is I'm still in a depressive rut and have no idea how to go about recovering and preparing for what comes next.

2023-10-31,1698748064,Teared up in front of my professor when talking about my data,"Hello all, 
TLDR : I have very high expectations for myself, created mental blockade, professor said data looks great and we can look at it together. I started tearing up because I thought he'd be disappointed in me. 



I just went to see my professor about a ""work experience"" class I have to do for my bachelor's. I chose this particular professor because he's very understanding and positive, he's also in the field i see myself working in in the next few years. The assignment was supposed to be for 6 to 8 weeks, however there is no time limit put on when it needs to be graded. It consisted of me gathering data and writing a protocol about it. The protocol part is what gets me really badly. 

I've been in the fields every day collecting data, even when the weather was bad. I wrote the introduction, why the plant is such a good model system for the phenomenon I'm researching, wrote down my hypotheses and started on the discussion based on what I learned from associated papers. However, I'm struggling with explaining my own data. I know it sounds stupid as hell and some of you are probably sitting here, reading this while doing your PhD and thinking ""damn bro you're stupid"", and I get it. I'm trying to make a perfect protocol for something that can never be perfect and there is no perfect and idk what's wrong with me.  

I took my sweet time with it and to be fair, I don't think other professors would have been so lenient with me. I wrote different exams and I went to work, pushing the ""protocol writing part"" further and further back. Now the guild hit me in the throat and I just keep having blockades. Thoughts like ""damn you took a lot of time to write a couple of pages now didn't you?"" And ""lol you do x and y instead of your damn protocol, you lazy cow."" 

I did go and see the professor and showed him my data and he said it's really good repeatedly, but for the life of me I don't know how to make any charts or if any of it it's even important?? Or does it even matter? I'm so scared of putting unimportant data in my protocol and failing, although I damn well know this professor would at least tell me something is wrong before letting me fail. Technically there is no chance of me failing, and even if I do, I can always redo it. So I don't really know what's wrong with me. 

Today I went to see him and I told him that everything is basically written out,however I am stuck at results. He said the data is great and we can just take a look at it together. I expected disappointment but all he showed me was empathy and understanding towards my situation. I started tearing up while he was talking to me about it and I feel really embarrassed about it, especially because there was another professor in the room, however he didn't say anything to me or about it. I'm supposed to defend my thesis to these two professors sometime next year and I feel like I fumbled and acted like a child, but the guild has been eating at my bones for a while now and feeling this release, hearing that all is OKAY and I don't need to worry about it so much felt so good. 

I always try to keep a cool head and keep my composure and resolve as much as I can, so you can imagine how embarrassed I feel right now, although no one judged me, not even a little. I just hope they don't secretly think less of me for stumbling over such a small stone.",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17khv0m/teared_up_in_front_of_my_professor_when_talking/

2023-11-04,1699114798,transcript hell,"Has anyone ever ran into this quandary? Back in 2005, when I was like 23, I applied to a community college for classes. I was accepted, paid the tuition, registered for classes and then like a week before classes started, had a change of heart and decided to move out of the state. I officially withdrew, got all my money back, and moved on with life. 

Since then, like, maybe 2010ish I had gone to college in another state, graduated, worked for a whole decade and then decided I wanted to go to nursing school. I applied to nursing school, sent only my transcripts from the school I went into 2010 and one other community college I went to, got accepted and then graduated from nursing school in 2022 w/ an associates. 

I just decided in the last month to go further w/ the nursing degree and applied for a BSN, which is basically just a bachelors in nursing. Applied w/ the info from my nursing school and my other college from 2010.

A few days passed and Ive been following my application status and see they got all my transcripts, and then get an email from them asking for transcripts from the 2005 school that i enrolled to but never actually attended. Honestly I had completely forgotten about it, it was almost 20 years ago.

So I thought no big deal, called up that school, went thru a phone menu from hell and ultimately got thru to what definitely sounded like an outsourced 3rd party customer service line. They referred me to Parchment, which I did go to. Filled out the info and sent it in. A day goes by and Parchment emails me with an automated message and tells me there is no record of me at this school. 

I called back, went thru the whole call menu fiasco again and tried to explain the situation again to another person, who just pushed me back onto Parchment. I reiterated my scenario again, and I hear her click a few keys, and then basically tells me to thru Parchment again.

At a loss, I just hung up, looked up an email address for the school and send in this long winded email explaining the situation again. I get a reply an hour later telling me to call the same number I had called before and reference a ticket number. I did just that, and then basically get the same response as I had the previous two times: Submit a request thru Parchment. 

Im assuming since I completely withdrew before classes started, I dont even show up as having a W and therefore a transcript for me doesnt exist, but yet I appear to show up in whatever clearinghouse database that exists out there that colleges look at it. I just find it kind of funny the other handful of colleges I went to before never brought it up.

Obviously I plan on contacting my new and hopeful college on Monday to explain, but Im curious if this has ever happened to anyone before?

Like, I tried to Google this specific scenario and I yielded nothing similar to my dilemma. I was just wildly curious what the outcome was if this has ever happened to anyone else? 

Now I just feel wildly inconvenienced that I've already spent several hours working on resolving this and getting nowhere. If theres a clearinghouse that has all our data, why cant admission offices just pull the data they need without sending admits on this wild goose chase?",college,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17np5i8/transcript_hell/

There were 100 questions on the exam and I reviewed and counted how many I got wrong twice and both times I counted 8 wrong so I got a 92.

When I went home and checked my grades, I saw my grade on Blackboard was a 90 instead of 92.

I am almost positive I only got 8 questions wrong, but I still acknowledge the possibility that maybe I counted wrong both times (?)

I emailed the professor and am waiting for a response, but in the meantime I'm just wondering if anyone else has ever encountered the same issue. I think the grades are automatically put on Blackboard by the system after the exams are done and not manually inputted by the professor, which is why this is confusing me.

Im sure a lot of you do the same, its easy when your schedule is packed with classes and a job. Its an awful habit and I feel it makes me miss the point of assignments, but I get good grades. Im not some genius who knows everything about everything, Im just really good at bullshitting. Give me a random topic for a given class and Ill have a full essay done the next day, with sources that work. 

Last Monday night, I started a presentation, essay, exam, and small homework assignment due the next morning. Exam went well, smaller homework assignment went well. Essay and presentation were over the same topic, I was to present Tuesday morning. I ended up feeling really sick before class (likely food poisoning), so I wasnt able to give the presentation. But I submitted the essay. Its not my finest work, but I got it done. I didnt expect much from it, I was just hoping my grade would be fine. I got it back and I got a B+. Main problem was that I didnt use in-text citations enough. 

I want to stop procrastinating so I can actually develop assignments and take something away from them other than a grade. But its hard when time and time again this method works.

2023-11-02,1698939682,I hate my major,"For reference, I am a sophomore in college, and my freshman year I switched from engineering to business. I was so excited for engineering and I absolutely loved it. The only reason I changed was due to my crazy first semester schedule including bio, chem, calculus, and history (I suck at history), and as a gifted kid in high school, I didnt know how to study and I ended up having to drop calculus and chemistry. My dad recommended I change majors, and so I did. 

I am now a business major and I absolutely hate it. Its not too hard, but I am so uninterested that I cannot force myself to pay attention. Whats also discouraging is I went to a STEM career fair and adored it but when I went to the business fair I didnt see anything that remotely interested me. 

I want to switch majors, but I dont know what to. I have no life plans and no career goals. I currently work in a bank and already know I dont want to do that for the rest of my life. I dont want to work a desk job, but with business it looks like thats what Im going to be doing. I havent picked a business sector to declare, but school is so draining to me because I know this isnt what I want to do, but I only have scholarships for 4 years of school, and switching now seems like a great way to lose money and stay in school longer. 

I really want to do data science, but at the college I go to, you have to pay for both the engineering and business schools, and that seems so extra. Engineering was going to be a way to get me to do data analysis, but business could do the same. I also like accounting, but I dont want to do a desk job. I want to make a comfortable amount of money as well, otherwise I would be a teacher. I believe Im good at math, but calculus was awful, and Im taking an online statistic like class right now and not doing well (which I blame the teacher and my lack of interest for). I dont want to be in school forever, so med and law school are out of the picture.  

Should I switch majors? If so what to? Are there any non desk jobs that business majors can receive? Should I just suck it up and finish since I have two years? I dont want college to be a bad experience for me.

As someone who didnt use my desk, I decided to give this roommate my study light and my comfortable chair. But when I had to use a desk for an interview, I asked to use his desk. He said yes at first, but then he started to ask me questions like why I couldnt use mine. Uh because my chair and light is at yours? He asked more questions, so I got annoyed and just said never mind Ill use my desk, dont worry about it. Then hes like why never mind? Im just asking wondering. So I took my chair and light back and had my interview at my desk.

The roommate is fucking inconsiderate. Including the lethal amounts of him vaping and smoking cigarettes which makes the apartment smell, after the desk situation, I was about to take a nap, blinds are closed, door is closed. The fucking dude come angry asf stomping in the room. He opens the door, the blinds, then he FUCKING LEAVES THE ROOM WITH THE BLINDS OPEN AND DOOR OPEN. It was definitely done in purpose and that set me off the most.

After what he did when I was trying take a nap and the whole desk thing, we stopped talking to each other. Then one day, I walk in my room and hes just dead looking my in the eyes. Like he wanted to kill me or something. What did I even do? I resolved the situation with the desk, so what are you mad about. He looked for so long and I had to ask him whats wrong. The mf didnt even say anything and walked out. 

Him and my other roommates are cool with him, which is fine. After all the shit hes done, I cant stand to hear his voice or be in the same room as him. I do want to hang out with the other roommates, but its a mutual thing where me and the roommate dont want to talk, so if we were to hang out with the other two roommates, the vibes will be weird for everyone.

They dont know we arent speaking to each other, but it lowkey hurt I didnt even get asked. So I guess this post is about what should I do?

Im a 1st year in college and have really been enjoying it for far. However, I have recently been offered a job that would last a week but pay incredibly well in my hometown. My home is 5 hours away from my school so it is far too long to commute, but looking at the syllabus, it seems like the classes I would be missing would be fairly calm days (meaning either time to work on projects or in-class discussions, which I have participated in a lot and am consistently understanding the material for).

A little more context- I go to a very academically rigorous college but have been keeping up in all of my classes so far and I think my professors generally see me as a very responsible and engaged student, so I dont think they would assume Id be skipping just for the sake of it.

2023-10-14,1697299931,My roommate is accusing me of bullying after confronting her about using my clothes and uncleanliness.,"You might have seen a different perspective of this story already (linked [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/1776ry4/my_roommate_is_telling_people_i_bullied_her_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) but I am the person whose belongings this roommate has been stealing from and this is my perspective. This is definitely going to be a long story so bear with me.  I am a senior in college, and was randomly assigned 3 roommates to share an apartment with.  Upon meeting them, we all got along pretty well.  We talked every day, asked each other for advice, and generally were good friends.  This was until 4 weeks ago.

4 weeks ago, my concealer went missing after pregaming and getting ready with my 3 roommates.  I didn't think anything of it, and assumed I was the person who misplaced it.  After this day, I noticed one of the roommates, we can call her Ally, that I do not share a bathroom with would go into my bathroom every single morning.  Me and the person I share a room with (let's call her Jenny)  both noticed, as the door is loud, and wakes up me, her and my dog.  This went on for over two weeks before I brought it up with Jenny.  She said it annoyed her as well, especially because it was at 7 AM, a time that no one in my room is awake.  We noticed Ally would be in our bathroom (which is connected to our closet) for at least 10 minutes daily.  Me and Jenny never understood why she would go in there because she has her own bathroom, and has no personal belongings in our space.  During this time, I was unable to locate a pair of leggings after a day that she went into my bathroom/closet.   I still assumed that I had misplaced them and was concerned, but not of stealing. That weekend, I went to my hometown, and took a suitcase.  When I got back to school on Monday, I was too lazy to unpack my suitcase and it remained in my room until Thursday.  When I opened my suitcase, I found my leggings which could only be possible if someone had put them there. Jenny with helped me look for the leggings before I left for over an hour and knew I was unable to find them before leaving the previous weekend.  It was at this point I addressed my concerns with Jenny.

I am going to list all of the concerns I discussed with Jenny:

* My concealer was missing. (I am a woman of color and the only other person who could have worn it was Alli)
* My leggings, that I wear at least once a week because I exercise, had gone missing (me and Ally are the same size and height)
* While I was away, I asked Jenny to remove my clothes from the dryer and she was unable to find them until the following day
* Over 10 different clothing items have deodorant stains on them.  This may not sound odd, but these were clothes that were clean and had not been worn by me in at least 2 weeks.  There were a number of sweat stains and smells coming from clothes I know I had not touched in weeks and even months.  THE CLOTHES SMELLED, and not like myself or detergent.

Once telling Jenny, we decided to tell the third roommate, Angie, who had her own issues with Alli.  Angie then told us about how Alli had been leaving panties with blood and excrement stains in their bathroom.  She had left bloody towels, hair, and just general trash everywhere. She then told me that she suspected Alli was using her face products as well.  Angie told me to check the rest of my belongings. It was at this point I noticed that most of my makeup was either broken or used, which is also odd because I have not used any foundation or makeup products aside from concealer and mascara for over 6 months.

We decided to confront Ally.  She did not deny anything immediately. She only stated ""I can't believe this"" for nearly 10 minutes before saying she didn't know what I was talking about. She even suggested a 6 foot man had been coming on to try my size XXS skims dresses while we were all gone. After this, she quite literally started throwing a tantrum.  She was yelling, screaming, and was offended that we had accused her of being a kleptomaniac. We all found this strange as we had never even used the word stealing. (We have since found out that she actually takes medication for kleptomania.) After this conversation, I informed an RA (who ended up being quite unhelpful and has a student conduct report for racism).   She stopped sleeping here, and told us she was moving out.  After a lot of emails, and weeks of her lies, she has finally started the move out process.

This has not been the end of Ally though, she has brought between 2-6 ""friends"" into our apartment at any given time to help her move out.  They hardly (if at all help) and become extremely argumentative with my other roommates and I.  It has gotten to the point where we can expect some form of harassment/confrontation daily.  She has told them that I am a bully, and a liar, when that is simply not the case.  I am offended that someone would even say that about me, especially without mentioning all of her absurd behavior during this time.  Does anyone have any advice?

TLDR: my diagnosed kleptomaniac roommate has been using my belongings behind my back and ever since we've confronted her about it, she's gone on to tell everyone that we basically bullied her out of our apartment to move out.",college,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/177sz22/my_roommate_is_accusing_me_of_bullying_after/

2023-10-30,1698690077,Most of us wouldn't be in college if it weren't to improve our job prospects.,"People say to go to trade school or not go to college if they don't want to learn and just want to get a job. To that I say, statistically speaking, college graduate are more likely to be hired for jobs and have a higher lifetime net worth which makes a college degree a good return on investment. This is because a majority of good paying jobs are gatekept by a college degree.  So it incentivizes people to get a degree for the sake of improving their job prospects. The reality is that most people don't go to college just because we care about learning. I think it's somewhat out of touch when people just say ""don't go to college"" in response to people who say they just want that piece of paper for a job and don't really care much about learning. Say that to everyone in the U.S who is going to college. You really think a majority of them want to spend so much money and time just because they like learning? Not to mention the fact that a U.S degree requires gen ed of subjects which are not relevant to our major and may be uninteresting. If we just want to learn, the internet is a free resource,  and we would not be spending tens of thousands of dollars and go in debt simply to *learn*.

I know people are going to counter this argument and say that a college degree in the U.S has benefits which is that it makes you more well rounded, intelligent, and whatnot. but is a majority of what we learn in college actually necessary for a job? nope. while the skills you learned in college can help in the job, a majority of jobs don't require skills beyond a highschool level education with the exception of certain professions like being a lawyer or a doctor where direct knowledge from your education matters. Going back to what I said, it is not worth spending tens of thousands of dollars just to become a smarter person.

Most of us go to college because it's a series of hoops we have to jump through so we can improve our job prospects in life. College for many people is just a means to an end.

2023-10-16,1697493403,Addiction in college: From a recovered addict in college,"Anyone who has seen a friend fall into addiction or lose themselves to the college party culture, i really hope that I can help you better understand how to help! 


Firstly, im 20 and a recovered addict(mainly benzos), I was a casual user in highschool, a functional addict the first semester of freshman year, and a shell of a person for 2 years. Ive been clean 6 ish months and have really worked on understanding why and how I ended up in such a bad place. Im sharing this here in hopes that someone can take what ive realized through recover and help their friend or roommate or partner start their recovery. Also huge disclaimer, this is my experience and things ive learned through research+therapy, it may be different for some people!


1:

The root of addiction is lack of connections, as people we all thrive when we are with people who care about us and working on things we care about. The biggest problem I had was social anxiety, I let myself take something so I would feel comfortable going out. In highschool I had friends who would make me feel comfortable in social situations, but at college I didnt. I found friends quickly, but they were not the best. I would get high before even hanging out with them 1 on 1 in an attempt to overlook the hurtful things they did. I had a large friend group, but I felt so completely alone so I numbed that. In numbing that, i numbed my desires, my feelings, my cares, and my need for reciprocation. 


All that to say, check in with your friends who are addicts, in a non judgmental, non solution focused way. Just listen to them. That makes more of a difference than you think. Even if you think you check in enough, make an effort to check in a little more. That can be what makes someone feel like they deserve to recover. 



2:

The situation gets out of hand so much quicker than the addict realizes. At first id get high 1-2 times a month, then 1-2 times a week, then everyday, then before i even got out of bed. I didnt think it was an addiction, i thought it was the college life. People would joke about me being a crackhead and i would joke about it too. That kept me in denial longer than I want to admit. 


Please dont engage with jokes about the status of someones addiction. You can hee hee and hur hur about funny stories while high, memories involving drugs, or your experience with certain drugs, but addiction should never be a joke. I didnt realize the jokes people made made were how they actually saw me until someone finally stopped laughing. 


3:


People always say addicts will get clean when they are ready and then cut off friends with addictions, obviously if your friend is stealing from you, hurting you, or a enabling your addiction please prioritize yourself, but if you have the capactiy to be real with them do it. I was never ready to recover, i would still be on drugs right now if I didnt have someone take the time to be real with me. You can be harsh, not hurtful, but telling them how they have let you down or been a bad friend can wake someone up. It probably wont be the first time, but stay strong in your stance. Call them on their shit. Be angry if they betray your trust. But under a blanket of support and love. 



It could really be as simple as 

Remember last weekend when we did x thing, you did (whatever they did), i didnt say anything then because you were high, but im really upset/hurt/embarrassed that you did that 

I really dont appreciate how you have been treating me. It seems like any time youre high you (insert hurtful behaviors). Im not mad at you, it just makes me feel like (how you feel)",college,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/179hzen/addiction_in_college_from_a_recovered_addict_in/

2023-10-15,1697383134,Is it normal for some people to never grow out of the 'Homesick first-year' Phase?,"I started my third year in August. I'm in a four-year undergraduate program so I'm in the second half of my college experience. I'm struggling a lot with homesickness right now, and I'm starting to feel like something is wrong with me, or that I'm somehow doing the college experience wrong. Here's some background:

The college I chose was the farthest one that I applied to- it happened to give me the best financial package and had a lot of great resources for my major. It's not terribly far away, but I only get to go home for breaks, more or less. It's about a 7-hour drive away and a 9-hour train ride. I don't have a car so I rely on the Amtrak to get home. Train tickets are not cheap so going home is a big financial strain.

My first year was very rough. I struggled to make friends and dealt with a lot of academic anxiety. On top of this, my dad and sister both had medical emergencies that year at different times so I was constantly stressed out over my family's health and just wanted to go home. The summer between my first and second year was heavenly.

My second year started much better. I had a more solidified friend group and went to concerts and day trips with them. I was more confident in my classes and was building good relationships with my professors. Fall semester was great, but even at its best, I still would have preferred being home. Then, in the Spring semester, I started to feel like the butt of every joke in my friend group. Not sure how the dynamic changed, but I voiced this to them and nothing really changed. They'd always make jokes about me with negative themes despite communicating that every now and then was fine, but constantly was starting to affect my self-esteem. They'd play it off as innocent fun and that I was getting worked up over nothing. I started to distance myself and felt more homesick than ever before until the summer came.

This year, I'm in a lot of classes with these same people. We're still 'friends', but I don't go out of my way to hang out with them anymore. I feel very isolated and alone. Every minute I'm here, I'd rather be home. When I'm home I'm so happy. I went back home a week ago for October break and I had to stop myself from crying all day on the last day that I was there. I absolutely hate being at college with every ounce of my being, but it's too late in my college career to transfer to another school and dropping out is certainly not an option with the amount of money I've already invested into my degree. I was hoping that I'd grow out of the 'Homesick' phase of college by now. As I mentioned, even at it's best, my college experience has always been plagued by homesickness. I've done everything in my power to make \*good\* friends, and nothing seems to stick. I've joined clubs, I had multiple jobs on campus, and I'm active in all of my classes, but I find it so hard to build those relationships that make it not awkward to ask if they want to hang out outside of class/club/work. I struggle with social anxiety too, which is definitely a huge factor in this. I keep in touch with my friends at home as much as possible, but it's hard when we're all going to different schools.

Has anyone else struggled with never-ending homesickness? I always miss my friends and family back home endlessly. Not a single friend I've made in college so far has actually made me feel loved and valued as my friends from high school do. I love my family so much and I miss living with them. I miss my pets so much as well. If anyone else has struggled with this well into their third or fourth year, how did you manage it? What can I do to get the most out of my college experience without my homesickness holding me back? I'm at the point where I don't even want to go home for breaks that are shorter than winter or summer because having to go back to college is too painful. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!

Edit: Adding a 'TLDR' 'cause I forgot to:

2023-11-01,1698870355,Felt bad for my english professor today,"Its a mandatory academic writing course you have to take for the school. The idea being that we learn who to write essays on topics for future classes.

We wrote in person essays last week and they were descriptive essays. 

He opened class by saying that a lot of essays were lacking in description and many of them had used a lot of the same words/phrases and that its worrying for their futures when writing or expressing themselves in academia.

He asked if anyone ever read Orwells 1984 in the past. I have and apparently I was the only one.(Its a really good book, I recommend it)

He mentioned that a plot point in the story is about the idea of newspeak and what Orwell meant by it in the book. The idea that if a person is limited on the words they know, than they are limited in thought.

He had us read a paragraph from a famous short story afterwards. 

Then he asked us our thoughts on it. Silence, awkward silence because no one wanted to give an answer or couldnt think of one.

Hes a good professor, he clearly likes learning about languages and teaching it but I could feel his dismay at seeing a real version of newspeak occurring in front of him.

I know its probably a mix of anxiety or apathy from students in class but it feels crazy to be literally one of two people in the class willing to answer or give an opinion on something in class and I see it all the time in my classes.

Hello everyone I just wanted to hear your advise. Ive been going to this specific university, and in each semester (2 years), I have a classmate who I will call Anna, who simply wont stop answering the professors class questions. 

Im someone who loves to participate in class, even though Im an introvert and dont usually talk that much to people. Having Anna around made me realize how much time shes taking out from my other classmates chances to participate. 

She always sits on the front, and when the professor asked a question, under one second, she would immediately answer the question as if she and the professor are having a one-to-one conversation, and it annoys the hell out of me because the class keeps to hear her side all of the time. 

She never raises her hands she just speaks, and then we had to listen.

Whats worse is that when a professor gets an answer, they move on with the topic.

Anna, youre great. You got some good answers. You got some bad ones. But, let the entire class speak. Some of us need those participation points too.

2023-11-04,1699095573,How to handle a roommate who appareantly hates me for seemingly no reason?,"It's been one and a half month since i've moved into a 3 person dorm room. They are both older than me and are former friends, enrolled in same year and are pretty close. In the first two weeks or so I tried to have conversations with them, knock on the door and say hi whenever i entered the room and stuff, basically things we would do with my former roommates. But i quickly realised even if they responded to me, they couldn't be bothered to do any of these and didn't seem to care when i did so i stopped as well. 

Even though i basically don't interact with either of them and can't study in the room because of the noise they make when they are both in the room and spend most of my time outside/library, especially one of them seem to can't stand me whenever i am present in the room? 

she keeps saying she cant sleep (not to me, to the other girl), she scuffs and pushes the blanket over the top of her head when im getting ready for an 8 am lecture (i only turn on my desk lamp and am walking on eggshells to not make noise). Meanwhile i wake up to her slamming the doors when she is the one who has a lecture early in the morning. She also asked me to turn off my desk lamp and study in the caffeteria the one night i didnt go to library (i was sick) because she had an exam tomorrow, and i had too. And guess what, i turned off MY fucking desk lamp and went downstairs.

The final straw that made me type out all of this was how terribly sick i was feeling yesterday evening when i got out of a lecture basically beaten up at 7 pm, found them both in a dark room one of them sleeping, the other one looking at her phone in bed and thought i could also get some sleep. They both ocasionally sleep daytime and i try to not make any noise and don't even turn on my desk lamp unless it is pitch dark. I sometimes just leave them alone and take myself out if i can. Yesterday was THE only day I went to bed early only for once and the very minute i put my head on the pillow after taking painkillers, one of them asked to turn on the blinding white leds at the ceiling, they both got up and started chit chatting real loud at the top of my bed. 

I was on the verge of tears trying to sleep under thw blanket until i finally asked that girl as sweetly as i could 'cant you just use your desk lamp or something?' she looked funnily at her friend one moment but then said fine without looking at me and got out of the room slamming the door on her way out before her friend finished the sentence ""are you seriously going out?"". i have never lived with people who showed so little sympathy towards me i felt horrible and pretended to sleep.

I dont think i can change my room anytime soon, the dorms in my uni are basically crammed and im really lucky to have found this room but this girl is driving me nuts. i feel so unwelcomed in my own room. do i try to talk to them about this and fail miserably or do i act like a bitch, how to deal with this?",college,14,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17nj8gd/how_to_handle_a_roommate_who_appareantly_hates_me/

Math has always been my strong suit but this college algebra class has been HELL.

None of my other professors blindly assign work and offer little resources or help for us. 

Regularly, MyMathLab will have questions thats arent taught in our resource material for our weekly homework. For instance well be learning about finding the zeros of polynomial functions for 3 term equations, and one off the wall question was on the homework about interpreting the graph to find the zeros of a 5 term polynomial using the quadratic formula. When I email her, at least 4 times this semester she said oh dont worry about that, I didnt know it was on there, Ill give credit to everyone OR I cant email an explanation, schedule a zoom call for more help. Then this kind of problem is never on a quiz or test. 

Recently, shes assigned us a quiz covering concepts from lessons/homework for the FOLLOWING week. She said in a D2L email the day that the quiz was due that its been brought to my attention yada yada, Ill be extending the quiz deadline to the day before next weeks homework is due. 

Yesterday she gave us a module 4 test, that are explicitly meant to be over the modules they pertain to, and not collective. The very first question on this test was an advanced concept from module 1. The tests are all proctored on Lockdown browser and we get one page of notes, and a very limited amount of time for each test. I got 100% of module 4s questions right except for the one from module 1 because I wasnt prepared for it. 

I emailed her, professionally pleading for an answer as to why, again, communication wasnt clear on important assignments. This was the only test this semester that wasnt exclusively over its respective module. None of my other professors would do something like this.

Now, I recently got a concussion and cannot use my laptop for more than 10 minutes. So I obviously emailed him with the slim hope of getting just some accommodations, and he begins to ignore me.

 (but will reply to any email that doesnt have to do with my concussion.)
And now Im failing the class because I legitimately cannot get assignments done.

Not just the questionable combinations of food (PB and J chicken wings? why?), but food poisoning is a decently common issue, especially at one of the halls. I still eat there cause there are not many choices, but yesterday broke me.

I like to use the ice machine and I understand they are never super clean. However, there was a dangling piece of black slime coming out of the machine. It was not rubber or a piece of the machine but honest-to-god slime. I ran out of the dining hall to retch and didn't go back cause obviously someone would've noticed that. I know the staff members use the ice machine and it was *not* subtle. 

This morning I go for breakfast and it's still there. I finally alert the supervisor and I watch as she just wipes it off with a napkin and pretends like it's fine. No bleach or sanitizer. No closing down the machine. I feel sick, this could make people seriously ill. I can't get in contact with the head of dining services or find who it is in the first place. 

Any suggestions on what to do? Would I be insane to contact the health department? 

Edit: Reported to the Health Department and while I didn't get any photos, I talked with staff from a different dining hall (that's never had issues with food poisoning).

2023-10-25,1698208279,"I need a new roommate, mines on Crack","I'm a senior in college and i was placed with a random roommate for this year as I am a recent transfer. He is a sophomore and started off as ok but seemed sort of difficultl. He immediately had us change the room the moment I walked through the door and set a very strict roommate agreement with lights off, bed times, no light at night, room always cold ect. That is fine with me even though I don't like the rooms cold. 

A few weeks ago he mentioned that he was using cocaine over the weekend without me prompting. Now I'm in the business of minding my business so I didn't push or ask, I just let it go. This past weekend, however, he stayed up all night and at 5 am he got up. I began hearing some banging noises and then he proceeded to snort several lines of crack. He then began entering and exiting the room, playing music really loud and stuff like that for the next few hours. I no longer feel safe with him or feel like I can set boundaries or maintain them properly at all. 

Problem is at my college it's really hard to find a room because it's a big college and anyone who is lucky enough to have their own room, (there are several on my floor), won't want to give it up. I have zero friends here so I can't move in with them and I can't afford a private room. I don't know what to do. Don't want to report because I have no idea if he even has more on him or what. 

Tl;Dr My roommate started out fine but it has escalated to him doing crack in the room and I no longer feel comfortable being around him or confronting him about breaking boundaries of the roommate agreement.

Update: My dad talked to some people who have had kids in college and what he said was if I go to my RA and tell them that we have different moral values and I no longer feel safe being in the room, the college should do their best to move me. And if they press for more information I tell them I'm not comfortable telling them why and I am not interested in having a mediated discussion with my roommate. If they press it further I ask for an administrator and then tell. Thoughts? Opinions? Anyone done something similar?

I feel like the school will be on my side since he has had a rape allegation already this year. ",college,38,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17fwp6j/i_need_a_new_roommate_mines_on_crack/

I used to think I was smart until I got here. I earned my associate's degree early, with high honors and over 20 additional credits. The problem is, many of my classes were easy (like, physical education or about law or government) and online. Here in university, I've switched to a STEM major and all of my classes are in-person. My highest grade is an 89%. I've never felt more stupid than I do here. Everything moves so fast, I don't know how to study or take notes, my brain won't focus or retain information even if I go see a tutor or go to office hours.

2023-10-13,1697225733,My roommate is telling people I bullied her to move out when all I did was tell her to pick her dirty underwear off the ground,"Hello! So the title might be seem comical and unbelievable, but unfortunately this has been my reality for the past 4 weeks. I wanted to post on here to get advice on what to do because this situation is clearly not normal (and there is even more to just the dirty panties), and I feel as though there should be some sort of actions taken but again, I'm pretty overwhelmed by this situation so I don't know what to do. There's a TLDR at the end also!

I (F21) was assigned a random roommate (F21) and we got pretty close at the beginning as we were getting to know each other. I live in a 4-person suite and all 3 of us have had our own problems with my roommate, ranging from cleanliness to outright stealing. Let me begin from where it all started so it all makes sense because it's a lot.

One of my other suitemate's was noticing that her clothes had gone missing and reappearing in random places mysteriously with deodorant stains on them and smelling worn even though it was just washed. As she went through her stuff, she found some of her makeup had gone missing, her unused perfume that had mysteriously shrunk from its original amount, and more of her clothes smelling worn with stains on them. She immediately suspected it was my roommate using her stuff because they are the same skin tone and size, and my roommate goes into their bathroom that is connected to their closet every single morning and stays in there for up to 10 minutes doing God knows what. None of us knew what she did in their bathroom, but this is an important detail that led us to believe that she could be the person behind this.

Moreover, my roommate has been caught stealing from me and lied to my face about not doing so. It was a late night, and all of us were at home. As I was in the common room, I noticed that my earphones that were right next to all of my belongings had gone missing, so I started to look everywhere for it. I checked everywhere, but to no avail... So I decided to ask my roommate who was on her bed. I asked her if she had seen my earphones that were on the table in our common room to which she said no she had not seen it anywhere. As I looked down at her bag that sat directly below her and next to her bed, I notice 2 wired earphones sticking out at the top of her bag: one was visibly standing out from the side pocket, and the other one laid on top of the bag. I grew suspicious and as I looked at it closely, I realized that the earphones that sat on top of her bag was mine (thank god I tied a knot in it - I was able to immediately recognize which one was mine, and then again, girl you had 2 earphones?!) So I told her that those were my earphones and the only thing she could say was apologize and that she must have took it unknowingly. This event made me extremely cautious of her so I decided to put all of my personal belongings inside of my luggage and lock it since my other suitemate has had her stuff go missing too.

On top of this event, my roommate is very unsanitary. She left used underwear that visibly had bodily fluids and blood on it right beside our table and mind you, our room is small and my bed is right next to the desk. So clearly I was disgusted, but I decided that maybe she didn't notice they were there and so I didn't say anything to save her the embarrassment. Maybe it fell out of her laundry basket, I decided to give her the benefit of the doubt. However... the underwear laid there untouched, unmoved, for over 10 days straight, and anybody coming into our room could see them in plain sight.  Just 5 days ago, she had left ANOTHER pair of used underwear and left it on the floor of our closet. It laid there for 5 days until I told her to put them away =- Also she had rotting food in our fridge that stayed there for over 2 months which caused dead gnats to appear inside of our fridge. Yes, there were dead bugs everywhere inside of our fridge because she did not care to ever take out any of her rotting food out of the fridge.

One night, me and my other suitemates decided to confront her about her behavior and ask her whether or not she was the one who has been stealing my other suitemate's belongings. What started as a calm, cordial conversation turned into screaming and yelling from her, and honestly it was an uncomfortable experience for me because my roommate immediately resorted to basically screaming that she didn't steal anything. Every single one of our points had an elaborate lie as an answer. When asked why she goes into their bathroom every single morning, she made up a lie stating that our sink was broken beyond use even though I still used it fine. When asked who else could be doing this, she stated that ""it could be that 6 foot klepto man that lives down the hall"" (she was being entirely serious when she said this). When my suitemate asked her why her clothes had been found with deodorant stains on them, my roommate immediately shut down as if we had caught her in a lie. She knew she couldn't get out of this one because we share a closet, and you can see the patchy old deodorant stains all over her clothing. The day after we had this confrontation, my roommate went into our closet and had wiped down all of the deodorant marks that were on her clothes, which is extremely shady. Moreover, she put her medication away, but before this event occurred she used to leave her medication on our bathroom sink. I got curious and I googled what the medication was for and it literally had Kleptomania for its primary uses =- But nevertheless, it does not end here.

Ever since this confrontation, my roommate has been bringing over multiple strangers into our apartment just to grab something and leave. However, while she does so, the people that she brings just stands by the door and glare at us menacingly =- like i cannot make this up it's so ridiculous. these people talk shit about us while we're right next to them, and make disparaging comments about our living space. From my understanding, she is going around telling all her friends that we basically bullied her out of the apartment. This is quite literally harassment because that could not be any further from the truth. All I asked was for her to be respectful of our shared living space and to be clean, and she went around and twisted the story to make it sound like we bullied her out... And people are believing her, too.

At this point I don't know what to do because all of this has taken a significant amount of mental toll on me especially during midterms, hence why I am asking for advice on here. I am quite literally on my last straw and I do not know what to do. I contacted HRL and she's moving out even though she was supposed to move out 2 weeks ago. It was completely her decision to move out. It's an incredibly uncomfortable situation for all of us, and I don't know who to contact for help because now she's spreading rumors about me. Any advice on this matter will be greatly appreciated!

My (18M/NB) roommate (18F) and i got along well when we were texting over the summer, and i assumed things would be fine. Everything was good until mid-Septemberish when she hooked up with people on two separate occasions with me in the room (i was awake for one, asleep for the other) up until this point, she was insistent that she would never do anything like this ever. I was awake when she hooked up with this girl (her now girlfriend), and she told me that they werent even gonna share her bed, and that her guest would sleep on the floor. Ive had a lot of struggles with sexual abuse in my life so these events were really triggering, especially hearing about how she hooked up with someone while i was asleep. i told our RA, who had me file a title nine violation against my roommate and both of the other girls, then we had a meeting with our RA about this whole situation. Since then, my roommate has hardly been back to our room for any longer than 12 hours, which isnt something i asked of her. 

on friday, her parents came and visited and she brought back a bunch of leftovers, and she asked if she could put them in the fridge (i brought i and i primarily use it), and i said yeah of course. well, theres something in her food that i am very allergic to, to the point that i couldnt even drink the water out of my brita without giving me a reaction. our RA told us that if there were issues we could write notes to each other, so i wrote her a note that said exactly this.

hey, im really allergic to something in your leftovers which is not your fault, but i would really appreciate you getting them out of the fridge.

i asked a couple friends who know the extent of everything, and they said it got the message across clearly and kindly. well i came back to our room between two of my classes, and she has reheated some of her leftovers, making my room essentially toxic for me to go into. am i wrong for wanting to contact our RA again? i spend a lot of time in there and i cant move. because of safety reasons, yet she has stated she doesnt need to be on the floor were on (gender inclusive floor).",college,39,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17jz1n5/do_i_have_a_bad_roommate_or_am_i_just_being/

The others who live there are great and I couldnt ask for better, but one suitemate never cleans. Its been 2 months and they havent done their dishes once or helped when we clean the common areas or take out the trash on weekends. They also do not contribute to the shared food supply (they use the most eggs and havent bought eggs once; we live in a high cost of living area). 

Yesterday, it started out like usually if me washing the dishes. It was like 40% mine, 40% my suitemate, and 20% my roommates (I dont mind doing hers because she also does mine). After I finished, I was like f it and asked the suitemate to clean the kitchen to see if they would do anything. Their first response to being asked to help was, Do you have anything going on today? To put it lightly that did not sit well with me. 

We have also been missing a bowl for 2 weeks, and I grew tired of not knowing where it was (they cost 50 cents so like that is not the issue), so I texted the group chat of our suite asking who had the bowl and please put it back. Well this suitemate saw it as a personal attack, to put it lightly. Not even 2 minutes later I get a text from their MOM asking if there were some concerns and offered $100 to help with community expenses. When I didnt immediately reply due to complete shock, I got a text saying she was ordering some new bowls and an electric kettle. When I declined the offer of her buying stuff for us, she then offered to come clean the common areas over thanksgiving break. I of course took her up on the $100 because I was essentially grocery shopping for them for 2 months, and in a subsequent text, she said, In a group some might be caretakers and others might not. EXCUSE ME??!!?!!???!!?? 

I found this whole situation entirely inappropriate. I am going to apologize to them because I did find the bowl in the fridge but the cleaning and grocery shopping, plus the fact THE MOM CONTACTED ME.

First, they couldnt complete their part because the day before the initial due date, they were at the other side of the country and didnt have time, even though our professor gave us two fucking weeks to finish.

My professor is extremely kind and understanding.  From what I understand, nothing in the syllabus implies that he doesn't accept late work. In fact, I remember being in class and him saying ""just turn it in when you can"" in reference to an assignment.

The reason I've been absent for so long is humiliating. I've been dealing with some pretty bad mental health issues and was diagnosed with PTSD a few weeks ago. I'm also already diagnosed with anxiety and ADHD. I've been having constant nightmares, flashbacks, and days without sleep due to intense anxiety and guilt. It started off with missing ""just a few days of class"" to allow myself to recover, but then I became too afraid to show my face again. I am about to start therapy for the first time soon though and I've been taking a prescription to help anxiety and sleep.

The reason I'm so embarrassed is that basically everyone deals with mental health issues. I understand that struggling is valid, but it's not a decent excuse to miss class for a month and expect the professor to let you submit tons of late work. My question is: should I explain my reasoning for missing class to my professor with medical proof? And ask if there's still a possibility of me passing the class if I complete all my late work and consistently attend class from now on? If yes, should I do this over email or in person? Or, should I just take the L and withdraw from the class with a W on my transcript and no refund. The last day to drop the class with a W is October 20th, so 3 days from now.

People tend to get annoyed with me for putting in any kind of extra effort, and it's making me start to resent school and I wish it didn't.

\----

I've always really liked learning for as long as I can remember. I always thought that college would be full of other people like me because people finally get to learn about things they really care about and that are (slightly) more relevant to the real world, but I haven't found more than a handful of people who really care about *learning* as opposed to getting through classes until they get their degree.

I also know that they're probably exhausted and losing interest or that they were just told they need a degree, so they do what they have to to pass. I've tried to find ways to meet other people who do care  and to get people interested via groups and out-of-class discussions too... It just seems like people are more annoyed with me than anything else. 

Even my philosophy professors (I'm a philosophy major) seem to be getting annoyed with the fact that I like to get into a bit more detail (1-2 extra questions/concerns per class, a 10 min conversation during office hours once a week at most) about what parts of the material I agree and disagree with. It seems like they'd rather I just accept the material and move on even though philosophy *is* the subject of questioning things.

Being constantly treated like I'm doing too much for wanting to really *learn* and not regurgitate is making me start to resent school, but I never want to get to the point of giving up on it entirely. Not sure if I should keep trying to learn or just figure out how to be happy doing the bare minimum. I just wish school were about learning again...

2023-10-27,1698422167,my class has an absolutely ridiculous attendance policy,"Someone please try to understand the logic of this attendance policy. Now my class has lecture twice a week and a discussion section once a week. We have an attendance grade that's worth 10% of our grade for lecture and an attendance/participation grade worth 20% for our discussion classes. 

Now in the syllabus it states that every absence from class results in a 10% grade deduction of your overall grade. That seemed completely illogical because whats the point of an attendance grade if you get docked a whole letter grade for missing class anyways right? So I went ahead and asked one of the TAs about that at the beginning of the semester and they told me that that policy only applies to our discussion sections which made sense to me. 

Now midway through the semester after I've already missed countless lectures but 0 discussion classes, I'm being told that the policy applies to lectures as well......

Whats the point of an attendance grade if you're losing a whole ass letter grade for missing class anyways?!?!?!

Edit: After some backlash, I wanted to clarify some things. I asked a TA about this policy **before** I started missing classes, and they explicitly told me that it did not apply to lectures. I also asked a separate TA a few weeks into class to double check, and they told me the same thing.

I reluctantly agreed to having a single room so that I could study and sleep better.

However, I am not distracted by loud noises. If it ever got too noisy in my room, I could go study in the library. I like all races, and I don't mind if someone has different beliefs from me.

I tried to send in my hand-written outline to the teacher, but she refused to take it.

What had me most upset was that the prof saw the AI similarity score on the draft as well and didn't even talk to me about it. I just don't think it's very fair to give me the ok to keep going with my draft if it had a false positive too.

I'm actively redoing this next essay because I'm genuinely afraid that it will get flagged too. If I get another false positive, there's a good chance I'll lose my scholarship. I just wish the teacher would work with me to sort this out rather than just giving me a zero and sending me on my way without talking it over.

It's not fair, right? I'm just trying to figure out if I'm overreacting or something.

EDIT 10/16: Thanks everybody for the advice. My current submission didn't get any false flagging (thank god,) so now I just have to see what I can do about that 0 on the previous one. Now that the new week has started I'll have to get in touch with the head of the department and see what I can do about it.

I create my freshmen comp class to be fairly easy. I grade mostly for effort and coherence. I try to give some in class work days as I know many of my students are athletes.

What to do when your professor asks questions on quizzes and exams that they never went over in lecture? 

This is an ongoing thing with all of her exams and quizzes, and she offers no extra credit for the class. 

Example: we learned in class that cooking cast iron increases iron absorption.

On the quiz: what increases iron absorption? 

The answer: cooking in cast iron and using acidic sauces.

Not once did she mention acidic sauces in class and there is no way this is a critical thinking Q with what shes taught. 

This isnt the only example I have but she locks the exams so I cant go look back at the specific questions. I am trying to remember the Q better now that I know she has answers she never taught. 

Another ex of how she asks questions: infants need 9 essential amino acids, adults need 8  (learned in lecture)

Question: how many amino acids do adults and infants need? (I remember this Q specifically bc I had to think it through)

I answered 8, she said the answer was 9(when I asked what I got wrong). I feel like this was a trick question?? Because both need 8, not 9. 

I emailed her about it and she didnt respond. I looked up her rate my professor and this is a common theme in this class and her more advanced class too (I will be paying $$$ to take the class anywhere else than with her next semester). She asks things she never discussed in lecture and sometimes the questions/answers are wrong. 

With the recent Q on cast iron, I asked for credit for the answer I gave because she never went over acidic sauces in class. 

Exact message: Cooking with acidic sauces was not taught in class lecture and there is no mention of it in the notes. Is there a way I could please receive credit for this question? I went back and re-watched the lectures as well as looking through my notes thoroughly and there is no mention of cooking with acidic sauces. Using cast iron is the only thing you taught us so there is no way I knew that. Thank you, name

The guy just does not teach. Hes an instructor rather than an associate professor or anything higher. He doesnt have lesson plans; he doesnt have a syllabus; he doesnt record and post his lectures online like every other instructor/prof at the school; he doesnt answer email; its unbelievably bad.

Weve had ONE graded assignment in 2 months of class and the assignment used multiple concepts that arent in our textbook that havent been taught in-class. The class average is 49%. The one assignment was due 9/24 and we didnt get it back until today, 10/19. The withdrawal deadline is only 8 days away, no refunds of course. ~70% of the class has a failing grade. The instructor said verbatim that there will be no grade curve on anything in the course. 

The guys lectures are him holding a 2L of Diet Coke while he rambles about his personal and work history. Hell tell us a story about how statistics apply to reporting the weather or something else totally unrelated to what were supposed to be learning. Sometimes hell show us how to solve some complicated statistics problem that has close to no basis or no basis at all to whats in our textbook; the class just stares at him with glazed over eyes because were all thinking how the hell are we supposed to follow any of this. We havent been introduced to any formulas, vocabulary, or anything meaningful. 

I emailed the department head once and the head got him to post a barebones syllabus on Canvas but theres been no other improvement.

I have 3 separate emails from this guy stating that studying abroad over the summer would complete my spanish minor because I was ""1 class short of graduating with a minor"" then. But here's the thing, I was in 18 hours last semester and the study abroad fulfilled 2 classes or 6 credit hours, so I dropped the class I was in for the spring and signed up for the summer study abroad.

so my main question is& do guys find it weird when girls make the first move? i barely know the guy, he doesnt even know my name, and he isnt in any of my classes. i think hes in one of the ceramics classes before mine, so im able to see him once my class ends and i have a break. i only know a few things about him from my friend. isnt it strange to ask someone for their insta or snap or whatever just based off of one interaction and the fact that i find him cute? 

tldr: ive seen a cute guy around, want his socials, is it weird for me to ask him + how do i even go about that?

Should I be worried?,"So I'm taking this class with a very respected professor in his field (International level) and I'm enjoying the material of the course very much. We had an exam this week, and I asked him a question through an email saying ""Hey, when I was writing the exam, I thought of a few questions I wanted to ask"" and proceeded to ask them in the email (I was interested in the topics, so I had some out of interest questions), but I was met with ""The exam is done, why would you want more questions"" and proceeded to answer my questions somewhat rudely by telling me to ""Google it"". I mean, the professor's job is to answer questions students have rather than tell them to google it so I found it unprofessional. I was interested in the material so I wanted to volunteer for his lab at first, but now I don't think so. Usually, he's really friendly in emails and in person, I don't understand why he answered so harshly. Did I say anything wrong? How worried should I be? Am I overthinking this?

So I have to take a mandatory health class to graduate with my associates degree. Its online and when I asked my advisor, she said it would mostly be quizzes and tests on what we learned. Well the class started today and our first assignment is to measure ourselves (waist, hips, legs etc) and send the measurements to the professor. Then we have to do a fitness test and send that to the professor (how many push ups, sit ups we can do in a minute, how far we can run). I dont mind the fitness test since I dont have to film myself or anything. But the measurements are extremely triggering for me as I struggled with bulimia from ages 14-19 and during that time, I was obsessed with measuring myself. Im now mostly recovered and part of that recovery has been to throw away my measuring tapes and to not measure myself. My question is; what should I do? I have to take this class so dropping it is not an option. Should I email the professor and explain? I hate telling other people about my ED, I feel it makes them look at me differently.

2023-10-12,1697143576,Professor won't let me leave class 5 minutes early,"I'm taking a class which goes from 3:30-5:30 PM. This issue is that the bus that I need to go on arrives at around 5:30-5:35. Before, the bus used to be right outside of the building I had class in, but the university just reopened the bus terminal which was closed due to construction. The terminal is around a 6 minute walk, which varies because of traffic signals and doesn't include getting down to the ground floor, so I may need to run to make it. I need to make this exact bus because I have a class to attend at 7:00, and I get home at 6:50. If I miss this bus I have to wait 30 minutes for the next one.

I have asked my professor if I could leave a 2 hour class, 5 minutes early each Thursday (1 out of 2 class days). I have tried repeatedly asking and stating points, but he just keeps saying that missing 5 minutes of a class every 2 class periods is a ""insurmountable"" and ""exceptional"" request. What can I do? Is it even the professor's place to tell me when I can and can't leave his class?

Edit:I've read a bunch of the comments, which are pretty mixed tbh, but I'm going to see if my family and my personal trainer can reschedule to a different day, where the professor of that class doesn't care when I leave. The bus also comes consistently late, so I will run to catch it when possible. Thanks for all the responses. I will take the L here.

I also didn't ask many times, just one time technically, but I replied when he said no, seeing if he could compromise in any way.

Also wanted to add that any professor in here, who thinks that students need to be in class the whole time, for classes they pay for, is crazy. If I do the assignments and the work and am at class early, I don't see how you justify not letting me leave early, or having that effect my grade. Your job is to teach and see that students know the material, not always check on them to make sure they are there to learn.",college,375,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/176gzup/professor_wont_let_me_leave_class_5_minutes_early/

2023-10-24,1698142570,Sunk 5 hours into two essays for them to count towards my grade.,"Edit: sunk five hours into two different essays just for them to not count towards any grade (even final grade)


Does anyone consistently do work for it not even count towards anything numerical in the class?

Yesterday I had two exams, one which I studied for about 25 hours, the other three hours. Then I had work- just a six hour shift. Then I get back home to spend five hours on writing essays that aren't even being graded. I think I went to bed at 1 just to go to clinical at 5. I'm running on four hours of sleep, I'm so cold and so exhausted. This is every week, doing the shit for this stupid art class which has more work involved than my pharmacology course. 

I'm a nursing student, I am past the point of caring about getting good grades, I just want to pass my non-core classes.

Should I talk to the prof? I'm not at work enough, I'm getting in trouble for not making the hours, I don't have enough time to study, I don't have enough time do spend on things that don't count for a grade. 

I'm a junior, my last 3.2 semesters. What do I even do?

Edit: okay, since some of you have issues with my post I'm going to make this crystal clear. 

Yes I am doing two degrees at once, yes this is possible. Look it up, lots of bachelor programs are partnering with different schools connected to magnet hospitals. I will graduate with my associates next may, and my bachelors the next may after that. Hence why I'm focused on my nursing courses and not my gen Ed's. Thank you so much to the person that pointing out my grammatical mistakes. I'm so sorry that I made this post when I was upset and on four hours of sleep and also on the OB surgical floor (high acuity if you're not in the medical field). So I was quite busy at the time and no my professional writing does not look like that. I am taking 19 credits, this art class is one credit, my clinical are 8 credits, my lab is 1 credit, my pharm course is three credits, my OB/PEDS/ MED SURGE course is three credits and I'm also taking a philosophy course for three credits. Im trying to finish my bachelors as fast as possibly, I never take a break, I take one class every winter break and three classes over summer. I've always done this and yes it sucks but school sucks and I want to get it over with. 

This class is not an art history course, it's called art anatomy where we have to pick events that we do essays and class presentations on, so every week two essays and two presentations plus traveling to an art Museum/ show to gather data. All in all this class takes me about 8 hours per week just to do the bare minimum. Which seems excessive since that's not accounting for the three hours of class time that it takes up during the week.

For those of you who encouraged me to talk to my prof, I did end up going to her in person after class. They do count for a grade, she was just using the wrong syllabus attached to the course (how do you not notice that you have uploaded the wrong document for a particular class is beyond me). So, yes I got it worked out with her, and now I don't feel as terrible about me ""wasting time"". 

And everyone that is saying ""if MLA is so easy why did it take you five hours"", this paper was five pages long, single spaced and a small font (in respect to the profs paper policy). Complete with citations, headers and formatting it takes a while to make. For all of you that say MLA is easy, in comparison it is, to APA. I've never been trained to do APA, even in high school and middle school everything was MLA all day. I've been writing in this format since- fifth grade. That was 8 years ago so by god, I would HOPE that I know how to do it by now. 

For all of those who came in with a supportive response, you're awesome, keep being you. For everyone that gave snarky responses, just why? Why can't you put yourself in another persons shoes.

2023-11-03,1699046665,College feels like an absolute waste of time.,"It all started in high school and not knowing what to do with life, though I knew I wasnt going to do engineering. And I knew that I loved anatomy and whatnot. So I enlisted in the army for 6 years as a medic and did that with the benefit of **almost** free college. I also worked in a hospital drawing blood and stuff and have a very good side hustle working with antique human skeletons (essentially museum conservation). I have now been working on a biology degree with the original intent on going to med school. But I dont want to go to med school anymore because Id like to enjoy my 20s-30s, have a life (I worked in a hospital I know what they go through) and not have 400k+ in debt. Now Ill get into why I feel like college is a waste, I have taken soo many classes, and its just like highschool. You take a class that has nothing to do with what youll do in a career and throw everything away that you learned once the semester is over. You do the real learning on the job, I worked with nurses that didnt remember anything important from college, I have had to teach them things in the hospital (I dont have a degree Im just a nobody). I swear I have met so many people with degrees that dont know much of anything. Also what really angers me is how there is no standard in colleges, each professor essentially writes their own rules. My chemistry professor made a pass/fail system 80% or more on each quiz to get a point. Any lower than 80% and youd get a 0%. Take the same class with a different professor, and the whole grading system is different. Go to the same class at a different college and it is taught completely differently. No standard at all. I have learned so much outside of college and have made wayyy more connections outside of college, I have grown wayyy more without college. I believe I can be successful without having a degree, seems like a waste of time.

Im just going to add that nobody in my family has a degree but some of my family members currently work on college boards. Funny huh no degree and making decisions for the college. Colleges are just a business trying to take as much money as they can.

2023-10-12,1697109542,Roommate is committing environmental warfare,"My (F19) roommate (F19) Ive had minimally no problems with until now. Were not best friends or anything, but weve gotten along and try to be respectful of each others space. 

Two weeks ago though, I started experiencing weird health symptoms in the room. My heart would start palpitating and it felt like I couldnt breathe, and my chest hurt. It was as if I couldnt get deep enough of a breath in. I had to go outside and eventually it went away in several hours. I attributed it to caffeine intake and anxiety. 

However, it started happening more often, with the addition of other symptoms like coughing, sneezing, sore throat, etc. I slept over my boyfriends dorm for two nights and noticed the symptoms dissipated and I didnt experience them at all during that time, so I started to wonder what in the dorm could be causing it.

 The culprit? My room mates wax melter. If you dont know what it is, its a heated cup that melts wax and releases fumes (chemicals to breathe in, yay!) into the air. I did some research on this and apparently its very common to be allergic to the paraffin in them. The nights the melter wasnt on, I didnt have any symptoms. 

I told my roommate I was likely allergic to it and explained how it was impacting me and that we shouldnt have it on anymore. She agreed and offered to look for alternatives. 

About four days go by and my health has improved significantly, I dont get any symptoms. Come the weekend and I start getting very bad chest pain and the sensation that I cant breathe right. I start thinking Well, the waxer isnt on, so it must be an issue with me.

&Until today I come back in the room after being out all day and she goes Ive had the waxer on more often ecause it smelled weird in here yesterday. ??? So instead of opening the two windows we have, you turn on the fumes that Ive said make me physically ill for the past day without my knowledge? 

I immediately feel a sense of disgust at how selfish and inconsiderate that was of her. I would understand if it was just a matter of me not liking the smell, but this feels like a complete lack of empathy and disregard for my health. Shes also majoring in something healthcare related which is even more concerning. 

I had to leave the room for the rest of the night with horrible chest pains and I got not a minute of sleep, which is awful because I have midterms today. I texted her about it at 3AM and she still seemed skeptical I was allergic to it and said she would only put it away after work rather than right away.

I feel disturbed by her behavior, and I dont really know if I want to dorm with a person like this and Im at a loss of what to do.

2023-10-18,1697650451,Mentally ill roommate: pls help,"I share a small dorm with another girl. Were both in our early 20s and live thousands of miles from our families for context. 

I was supposed to live off campus this year with a friend, but stuff happened and the apartment fell through so we both had to move back on campus. Since we switched living situations so late, we both had to go random for roommates. Thats how I ended up with this girl, P. 

When I moved in, P told me she was a senior. It became apparent very quickly that she didnt have any friends. I also figured out that she had a very severe binge eating disorder and depression. 

I tried to be friends with her. I invited her everywhere I went with my own friends and she always declined. 

Sometimes she will be sweet, and then she will have an uptick in her mental health issues and take it out on me. Think screaming at me out of the blue for things out of my control (like political issues, global events, etc) and hurl verbal abuse at me for existing (mind you the room is usually silent before she starts literally screaming). 

We have gotten a noise complaint for her screaming before too. 

She has told me that in the past she would get depressed and make up stuff about her classmates so they would get kicked out of their activities and be sad like her 

We have lived here since august and she has never done laundry. I can count on my hands how many times I have seen her go to class. All she does is rot in bed, watch YouTube videos and tiktok for 12 hours a day and binge eat.

She also has an online boyfriend who is clearly a scammer but were not even going to get into that. 

Anyway, weve begun to have an issue with the room smelling. Its probably from the amount of dirty laundry, trash and rotting food on her side of the room. Every time I try to clean up a bit she screams at me to stay in my lane. The issue is some of the trash is making its way onto my side of the room so it is within my lane to clean it. 

Since she ran out of clothes, she started using mine as well as my makeup, hair products, etc. 

I think she even sleeps in my bed when Im not there because I dont have trash on it. 

I have tried to set boundaries but nothing has stuck. The RA is involved and he cant get through to her either. The school doesnt want to escalate anything because her father donates a ton of money (he is a multi millionaire in Asia) and wont jeopardize losing their paycheck from him. Everything is documented, its just nobody wants to DO anything. 

The school said I could switch dorms at the semester mark, but until then all the dorms are full so I have to make do. 

I just have no idea what to do until December. I basically live in a depression room which is starting to effect my mental health a ton. I also feel like a burden to my friends since Im at their places almost everyday. 

Im afraid she will make stuff up about me to get me kicked out of activities like she has done to others in the past if I keep trying to put up boundaries. It doesnt help that shes openly Islamophobic and Im Muslim and have Muslim stuff in the room. Also yes, I did tell the school about that and they said Im probably misunderstanding her and that everyone is panicked with the Hamas stuff rn. 

I also feel really bad for her. Her family is thousands of miles away and shes clearly so mentally ill and need support. 

I just feel so trapped. All my roommates in the past have been so lovely so this is completely uncharted territory for me

My nose bleeds can range from a few spots, to a dripping gushing mess. This one started as a few drops so I used a tissue and plugged it. Few minutes later it bled through. I replaced the tissue and threw out the old one, then tried to get back on with my test. Again, not even 2 minutes later I bled through it and I was out of tissues. I had reached the visible pour of blood and didn't want to make the room a biohazard or disturb anyone. My professor was sitting at the back of the room (I was at the front) so I guess he didn't fully see what was happening but he let me go.

I was in the bathroom for about 10 minutes cleaning up and trying to stop the bleeding and make sure I wasn't going to pass out or anything. Once it was controlled, I went back to the room and had about 25 minutes of the test left. When I finished (+ I used some accommodation time lol), I went to turn it in and my professor stopped me.

He pretty much told me that he was going to talk with the other physics department members, my advisor, and possibly other admin members since he suspected me of cheating. His reasoning? I had my phone in my pocket when I went to the bathroom. It was off and everything, but it was enough suspicion to warrant me possibly failing this exam, or even getting other large scale consequences.

The best part, is that I wont have a chance to defend myself or know jack shit about this until the end of the month because tomorrow marks the first day of fall interim.

2023-10-13,1697168126,Should I tell my professor that he forgot to enter my test grade?,"I'm not 100% sure but I think my math professor straight up forgot to add my math test grade to Canvas. My class took the test last week but by the end of that week, everyone who I've talked to said that their grade was already in Canvas. My grade still isn't in there, but I don't know if I want to tell my professor because when he'll add it, it'll lower my grade significantly. I already know what my score is, I got an 80%. So yeah it's kinda bad because if he added my test score to Canvas, it'll change my overall grade from 100.28% to 85.37%. I really don't want my grade to be anything below a 90%, so I don't know what to do. Would I get in trouble for not telling my math professor? Or could I just say that I didn't see that my test grade wasn't there?",college,83,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/176pigv/should_i_tell_my_professor_that_he_forgot_to/
2023-11-03,1698972251,Accidentally Got Accepted To A School,"So I'm aware that the title sounds strange, since obviously I applied to get into a college but hear me out. 

I'm a senior in high school, so I've been applying to a lot of colleges. I have my main handful that I'd actually want to go and then a bunch of safety school. All of my safety school were free to apply to, and I didn't do much research on them since I don't actually intend on accepting any of their offers.

One of my safety schools got back to me with an acceptance letter and a 40k scholarship (10k each year), so I'm really happy. I ended up looking up the school for the first time, just to find out it's a competitive private school with a 55% acceptance rate.

Now I'm smart, but my grades don't reflect it. I have a 2.4 accumulated GPA and struggle in school. How I got accepted and got a scholarship is beyond me, but now I might be going to a private school >7<ü@

Edit: I won't be in a dorm since a family member offered me her spare room if I do accept since she lives really close. The cost of the school with financial aid and the scholarship is about 11K each year.",college,32,https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/17min04/accidentally_got_accepted_to_a_school/
2023-10-19,1697723846,Should I turn down a higher level school to go to the same state college as my bf?,"I have an opportunity to possibly go to a prestigious out of state university, but am not sure if I should take that opportunity or stay in state so I can go to the same school as my boyfriend. I would love to go to the out of state university, because it would allow me an easier path into law school and build a name for myself, however the tuition is much higher than the in state college and I will be less likely to receive a scholarship for academics. On the other hand, if I were to stay in state, the tuition would be much lower and I could receive a scholarship much easier than if I were to go to the out of state school. Furthermore, I feel like I could stand out more in the in state school than the out of state school. ALSO ALSO; my current boyfriend is going to go to that school and I really dont want to give up our relationship. Sooo idk what to do guys plz help Im begging.
