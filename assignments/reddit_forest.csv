2023-06-10,1686421537,Floyd Lamb Pond,"

This was a strange day for me. It was a Monday and my instructor took over teaching for the day. No one was at the park and it was a quiet sunset. The trees showed dying leaves and the colors began to pop out. Something strangely unique about the desert is how colors can change in an instant. The quiet of the waters and the ducks swimming made it feel relaxing. 

The cold weather made me quiet and alone in my thoughts as I shot this piece. Being alone in silence when no one is there but yourself you dont feel lonely, but I felt excited to capture this beautiful park on the North End of Vegas.

2023-09-11,1694403836,Towns with Good Schools,"My husband and I are hoping to relocate in the next 2-3 years. We are looking for a place with lots of nature and greenery/forests. (We both rock climb and camp). My husband would love to be around bodies of water where he can fly fish. We need to be around good schools for our kids. He works remotely, and Im an acupuncturist. We were thinking of somewhere in the PNW, NC, or the Catskills in NY. 

Any recommendations on towns/cities that you love or think we would?

First I thought it was a dry branch falling. But then it kept going, quite literally sounding like was dragging a large branch across the floor. But it kept on going. We stayed for a while just listening trying to understand what it was. We packed  up and left and it was still happening.

2023-10-22,1698011966,Koalas and Their Vital Role in Forest Ecosystems =(<?,"
Hey fellow nature lovers!

I wanted to shed some light on the adorable but crucial residents of our forests - koalas. These iconic marsupials play a significant role in maintaining the health of their forest homes. <<?

The Koala's Habitat:
Koalas are primarily found in the eucalyptus forests of Australia. These trees are their main source of food and shelter, making them indispensable to the ecosystem.

Seed Dispersers:
Koalas play an unexpected role as seed dispersers. When they munch on eucalyptus leaves, they aid in seed distribution, contributing to the regeneration of the forest.

Ecosystem Health:
Their presence in the forest helps maintain a balanced ecosystem. By controlling eucalyptus populations and promoting diversity, koalas keep their environment in check.

Conservation Challenges:
Koalas are facing threats due to habitat loss and climate change. Understanding their significance in forest ecosystems is essential for their conservation.

Let's discuss the incredible koala and their role in preserving our forests! <3=(

Koalas, forest ecosystems, eucalyptus, seed dispersal, conservation.

Feel free to share your thoughts or ask questions about koalas and the forests they call home! <<?",Forest,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forest/comments/17e4j4s/koalas_and_their_vital_role_in_forest_ecosystems/
