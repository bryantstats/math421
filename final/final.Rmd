-------

**Submission Guideline:**  Include to your Github page the link of the app for each question from 1-12. You could also embed all your shiny apps in an Rmarkdown.  See the note under Question 4 for how to embed shiny apps in a Rmarkdown file.

-------

### Question 1. 

Create an empty dashboard. In Rstudio, File -> New File -> R Markdown -> From Template -> Flex Dashboard. Knit the rmarkdown file and add the html link to this report. 

### Question 2. 

Use this flex dashboard ([dashboard](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/final/flex_template.html), [Rmd](https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/final/flex_template.Rmd))  to create a flex dashboard that

- Has at least three main Tabs

- Has at least four plots

- Shows a table data that can be searched

- Has a side bar

### Question 3. 

We want users to be able to interact with our dashboard.  This can be done using `shiny`. Follow these below steps to create a shiny flex dashboard then publish it to the Internet. 

- Install the following packages `shiny`, `packrat`, `rsconnect`. 

- Go to https://www.shinyapps.io/ and create an account 

- Go to https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/dashboard.  Account -> Tokens -> Show -> Show secret-> Copy the secret code. 

It should look like this


```{r, eval=FALSE}
rsconnect::setAccountInfo(name='fall20',
			  token='E130D64F22776383660DA7EA5251EC04',
			  secret='mJI7rgq2Wf46g2Wf46g2WNOa+E6NRqr26yG3N5')
```

- Paste the secret code into Rstudio Consile and Run it. 

- Download a sample shiny flex dashboard: https://bryantstats.github.io/math421/final/1_flex_select.Rmd

- Click `Run Document` (Or Ctrl + Shift + K) to check the dashboard

- On right, top corner click Publish to Publish the dashboard to your acccount on shinyapps.io

- Your published dashboard should look like this

    https://sn904109.shinyapps.io/1_flex_select/


### Question 4 - selectInput

Write a shiny flex dashboard that uses `selectInput` working on a dataset different from the titanic dataset.

Note:  In the dashboard, click to Source Code to show the codes. 


### Question 5 - checkboxGroupInput

Write a shiny flex dashboard that uses `checkboxGroupInput` working on a dataset different from the titanic dataset.   

[Similar dashboard](https://sn904109.shinyapps.io/2_flex_checkbox/)


### Question 6 - sliderInput

Write a shiny flex dashboard that uses `sliderInput` working on a dataset different from the titanic dataset.   

[Similar dashboard](https://sn904109.shinyapps.io/3_flex_slider/)


### Question 7 - radioButtons

Write a shiny flex dashboard that uses `radioButtons` working on a dataset different from the titanic dataset.   

[Similar dashboard](https://sn904109.shinyapps.io/4_flex_radio/)

--- 

**Notice:  You can only run 5 apps on shinyapps.io.  If you are running out of apps, you are recommended to create another shiny account and use multiple accounts.**

---

### Question 8 - dateRangeInput

Write a shiny flex dashboard that uses `dateRangeInput` working on a dataset different from the titanic dataset.   

[Similar dashboard](https://sn904109.shinyapps.io/5_flex_date_range/)


### Question 9 - Combination

Write a shiny flex dashboard working on a dataset different from the titanic dataset. The dashboard should use at least three different input methods.

-------

### Question 10

Write an app that make uses of `selectInput`, `sliderInput` or `dateRangeInput` or both, `radioButtons`, `checkboxGroupInput`  and `navbarPage`. You might use multiple datasets for the app. 

-------

### Question 13 - Presentation

Present your shiny app in Question 12 on the final exam day. 

- Present the features of your app 

- Discuss the codes of the apps. 

- Discuss any error or challenge you had to overcome

- Give an advice for anyone who is about to do this project

- The presentation should be accessible to ones that have no experience with shiny coding but know R.
